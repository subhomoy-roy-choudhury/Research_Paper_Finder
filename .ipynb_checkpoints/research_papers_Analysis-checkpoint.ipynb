When a voltage is applied across the elements, the upper layer elongates, while the lower contracts producing a deflection. The control scheme consists of a feedforward neural network controller and a fixed-gain PID controller. This neural network controller is trained so as to make the output of the PID controller zero.

The CSI estimation algorithm based on adaptive compressed sensing (CS) is an efficient method.

In this paper, an enhanced multi-resolution hierarchical codebook design is proposed to realize precise AoD/AoA estimation. First, the necessary number of sampling angles for generating the codebook is given. Then, the algorithm of iterative adjustment (IA) is developed to improve the codebook design. Simulation results show that using the proposed codebook design, the beams can precisely divide the AoA/AoD intervals as the requirements of the adaptive CS based algorithm. Thus, the average angle estimation error is reduced effectively.</td>\n",

Although individually small, when accumulated over an operating cycle, the voltage deviations are sufficient to distort the applied PWM signal. This paper presents a new method to correct for the dead time deviations. The pulse based compensator is less hardware and software intensive than other dead time compensation methods providing a low cost solution. The pulse based technique is developed by analyzing the effects of dead time on a pulse by pulse basis and correcting each pulse accordingly. The technique is evaluated through simulation and experimental results. Other compensation methods are evaluated and the results compared with the pulse based technique. This comparison indicates previous methods can produce magnitude and phase errors in the applied terminal voltage, whereas the proposed method compensates for the dead time without significant magnitude and phase errors in the terminal voltage of PWM voltage source inverters.</td>\n",

As GPU-enabled CNNs move into safety-critical environments, reliability is becoming a growing concern. In this paper, we evaluate and propose strategies to improve the reliability of object detection algorithms, as run on three NVIDIA GPU architectures. We consider three algorithms: 1) you only look once; 2) a faster region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN); and 3) a residual network, exposing live hardware to neutron beams. We complement our beam experiments with fault injection to better characterize fault propagation in CNNs. We show that a single fault occurring in a GPU tends to propagate to multiple active threads, significantly reducing the reliability of a CNN. Moreover, relying on error correcting codes dramatically reduces the number of silent data corruptions (SDCs), but does not reduce the number of critical errors (i.e., errors that could potentially impact safety-critical applications). Based on observations on how faults propagate on GPU architectures, we propose effective strategies to improve CNN reliability. We also consider the benefits of using an algorithm-based fault-tolerance technique for matrix multiplication, which can correct more than 87% of the critical SDCs in a CNN, while redesigning maxpool layers of the CNN to detect up to 98% of critical SDCs.</td>\n",

The GP-WADV method aims to find the point closest to the obstacle on the link of the manipulator and attach the additional deviation velocity with weighting factors to the point on the basis of the gradient projection method. Utilizing multi-solution characteristics of redundant robots, obstacle avoidance control parameters related to the distance between obstacles and links are proposed according to the gradient projection method for solving inverse kinematic solution. Moreover, a weighted method is adopted to adjust the weighting factors of the primary motion velocity and the additional motion velocity when the link approaches the obstacle, so as to obtain the joint angle solutions more quickly and accurately. The GP-WADV method can ensure that the manipulator can avoid obstacles smoothly without turbulence and solve the highly nonlinear relationship between the position of the manipulator and the joint coordinate, which has the advantages of small amount of calculation, more flexible and convenient real-time control. The advantages of the proposed GP-WADV method are proved by simulation and experiments.</td>\n",

The effect of different concentration Stevioside glycosides blending liquid (SBL) on the yield and quality were studied. The best concentration and method of SBL were discussed. The result of the experiment showed: the appropriate spraying concentrations of SBL on upland and irrigated rice can enhance the grain per ear and the percentage of grain filling and then improve the grain yield up to 13.8% in upland rice and 9.4% in irrigated rice, decrease the amylase content of upland rice and irrigated rice, and reduce the gelatinization temperature, and improve the crude protein content of brown rice and the nutritional quality of rice, thus enhance the cooking and eating quality rice. It can improve the quality of appearance because the chalky rice rate and chalkiness degree decreased. Thus, appropriate spraying concentrations of SBL can improve the economic quality of rice and increase the economic benefit of the farmer.</td>\n",

All the films found to be fully amorphous in structure were continuous with uniform thickness and surface morphology. Their optical transmittance in the range 50%-85% was found to be film thickness dependent over the entire visible regime. The Verdet constant (V) and Faraday rotation angle (θ\\nf\\n ) for different films (~4-18 nm) investigated as a function of wavelength (λ) show considerably higher values for the films of Fe-B-Nb-Y alloy as compared with those for Fe-B-Nb films, e.g., the ~4 nm film of Fe-B-Nb-Y alloy exhibits V ~ 49°/Oe cm and θ\\nf\\n ~ 26°/μm while it decreased to ~29.4°/Oe and ~11.8°/μm, respectively, for the Fe-B-Nb alloy at λ = 611 nm. A linear relationship is found for the wavelength dependence of V and θ\\nf\\n for both alloy systems. To the best of our knowledge, these values are considerably higher than those reported for any other magneto-optic material. The films are found to be soft magnetic with a high saturation moment while their magnetic coercivity values increases with thinness of the films.

Depth image based rendering algorithms will play a pivotal role when synthesizing an arbitrary number of novel views by using a subset of captured views and corresponding depth maps only. Usually, each depth map is estimated individually by stereo-matching algorithms and, hence, shows lack of inter-view consistency. This inconsistency affects the quality of view synthesis negatively. This paper enhances the inter-view consistency of multiview depth imagery. First, our approach classifies the color information in the multiview color imagery by modeling color with a mixture of Dirichlet distributions where the model parameters are estimated in a Bayesian framework with variational inference. Second, using the resulting color clusters, we classify the corresponding depth values in the multiview depth imagery. Each clustered depth image is subject to further sub-clustering. Finally, the resulting mean of each sub-cluster is used to enhance the depth imagery at multiple viewpoints. Experiments show that our approach improves the average quality of virtual views by up to 0.8 dB when compared to views synthesized by using conventionally estimated depth maps.</td>\n",

The latter requires that the muons be accelerated as rapidly as possible to prevent particle loss. The former allows one to loop back and pass through the same linac multiple times, thereby achieving potentially significant cost advantages. Some of the acceleration systems will use recirculating linacs to achieve the reuse of the accelerating structures. However, the large longitudinal beam emittances make it difficult to simultaneously achieve large gradients by using high frequency RF and design an arc with a sufficient energy acceptance. The current state of the design for the acceleration stages for a muon collider is presented, with emphasis on systems accelerating to 70 GeV per beam. Known difficulties will be described as will their possible solutions. In particular, the use of an FFAG-like lattice for the arcs of a recirculating linac is described which accepts a beam with a very large energy spread over a wide range of energies, allowing a single are to be used instead of multiple arcs.</td>\n",

Stopband attenuation of filters is from 32 db to 63 db with the gap about 3 db. With same performances of stopband attenuation and transition width both the order and passband ripple of filters using the new method is little better than that using Kaiser window if passband attenuation is smaller than 50 db and little worse if bigger than 52 db.

Such a coarse quantization of the prediction residual can produce audible quantizing noise in the reproduced speech signal at the receiver. This paper describes a new method of quantization for improving the speech quality. The improvement is obtained by center clipping the prediction residual and by fine quantization of the high-amplitude portions of the prediction residual. The threshold of center clipping is adjusted to provide encoding of the prediction residual at a specified bit rate. This method of quantization not only improves the speech quality by accurate quantization of the prediction residual when its amplitude is large but also allows encoding of the prediction residual at bit rates below 1 bit/sample.</td>\n",

The convergence of the equatorward neutral winds happened in this particular event related to midnight temperature maximum (MTM) and that the equatorward winds in both northern and southern hemispheres could be responsible for the growth of plasma bubbles around midnight. The uplift of F-layer at low latitudes could increase the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

Filament generation and their lengths are controlled by current pulses through the element. A general in-package trim technique was developed using the trimistor and a high-voltage high-current diode, allowing the package pins to be multifunctional. This combination permits the input offset voltage for each channel of a quad op amp to be trimmed in the package to 10 /spl mu/V. The differential input stage utilizes JFET followers, which allows the separation of JFET/bipolar biasing currents. This results in a low offset voltage temperature coefficient (1/spl sigma/) of 2.5 /spl mu/V//spl deg/C. The gain-bandwidth product is enhanced over the unity-gain frequency by using a dual-doublet frequency-compensation technique. One doublet is defined using the JFET follower with feedforward capacitance, and the second doublet is formed by local positive AC feedback applied to the input current mirror. The amplifier is unity-gain stable, with a 100 MHz gain-bandwidth product (at 100 kHz) and 25 V//spl mu/S slew rate.

If guarantee funds are to be effective, a majority of firms can obtain financial assistance through corporate bonds market. This paper describes the mutual guarantee bond which can be a viable solution to the problem of access to credit from capital market for small and middle-entrepreneurs. This work uses a jump diffusion process to estimate the price of mutual guarantee bonds made under the terms of the China Small Business Financing Program. First, a logistic structural model of mutual guarantee bond is built up. The model was then employed to design the logical pricing model of credit spread when an exogenous default process jumps for the first time. A geometrical attenuation function is introduced to reflect the unexpected default of intensities. Furthermore, the pricing model of collective small-medium corporate bonds as the spot interest rate is assumed to follow Vasicek model. Finally, the work tests the pricing model with one thousand times Monte Carlo methods and offer theoretical background and empirical evidence for further financial innovation as well.</td>\n",

However, many AI-enabled Internet-of-Things (AIoT) systems are vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. Therefore, designing robust deep learning models that can be deployed on resource-constrained devices has become an important research topic in the field of 6G-enabled AIoT. In this article, we propose a method for automatically searching for robust and efficient neural network structures for AIoT systems. By introducing a skip connection structure, a feature map with reduced front-end influence can be used for calculations during the classification process. Additionally, a novel type of densely connected search space is proposed. By relaxing this space, it is possible to search for network structures efficiently. In addition, combined with adversarial training and model delay constraints, we propose a multiobjective gradient optimization method to realize the automatic searching of network structures. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective for AIoT systems and superior to state-of-the-art neural architecture search algorithms.</td>\n",

In this paper, we focus on the implicit RTO offset problem, where the exact timeout limit of each packet is stretched by restarting the timer using the current timer value on the arrival of each acknowledgement (that acknowledges some new data). It would result in a slow timeout detection which unavoidably degrades the TCP throughput. In this paper, we first present a review of the TCP-RFC with special focus on the implicit RTO offset problem. Based on the insights obtained, we propose an enhanced RTO timer implementation, called E-RTO, for TCP. The implicit RTO offset is removed by mimicking the operation of a multi-timer implementation using a single timer. We then compare our E-RTO with TCP-RTO by simulations. We show that the faster timeout detection of our E-RTO leads to a throughput improvement of up to 3%.</td>\n",

Currently, methods exist for tracking rolling leukocytes in vivo which rely on manual detection of the cells. In this paper, a new technique inspired by the teardrop shape of the rolling leukocytes is presented for accurately detecting rolling leukocytes. It is based on a feature score, the gradient inverse coefficient of variation (GICOV), which serves to discriminate rolling leukocytes from a cluttered environment. The leukocyte detection process consists of three sequential steps: The first step utilizes a novel teardrop shape matching algorithm to coarsely identify the leukocytes by finding the leukocytes resembling teardrops with a locally maximal GICOV. Second and third steps involve evolution of B-spline snake starting from each of the teardrops found in the first step to refine the leukocytes boundaries and associated GICOV score, and retaining contours with high GICOV scores. The detection process is observed to yield superior results compared to other methods currently in use. The deformation information inherent in the teardrop shapes gives valuable information about the extent to which the cells are adhering to the endothelium.</td>\n",

Manual identification becomes exceptionally challenging and time consuming because of the distinction in morphologies and size of lesions. Manual annotation of lesions by professionals is labor intensive and therefore requires the development of automatic segmentation techniques, but still it is also a challenging task because of the low local contrast and small size lesions present in the image. The automatic segmentation of retinal lesions through deep learning approach is of great impact for the initial diagnosis and treatment of DR. This paper proposes a patch based approach using encoder-decoder neural network to perform retinal lesions segmentation in fundus images. The architecture is trained and validated on IDRiD dataset which consists of microaneurysms, hemorrhages and hard exudate segmentations. In this approach for creating image patches a sliding widow technique is used, later the network evaluates the patches of the images and produces a probability map that predicts different types of lesions. An elaborative experiment was accompanied on IDRiD to calculate the performance of the suggested approach. The projected sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 97.24%, 99.97%, and 99.97% respectively, which validates the effectiveness and dominance of this technique. When compared with other studies on similar tasks, the results obtained by this work indicate substantially improved performance in terms of sensitivity &amp; specificity.</td>\n",

We estimate the redshift distributions of the samples using phenomological models, simulations and photometric redshifts, and so derive the spatial correlation lengths. We compare our results with the Galaxies In Cosmological Simulations (GalICS) models of galaxy evolution and with parametrized models of clustering evolution. The GalICS simulations are consistent with our angular correlation functions, but fail to match the spatial clustering inferred from the phenomological models or the photometric redshifts. We find that the uncertainties in the redshift distributions of our samples dominate the statistical errors in our estimates of the spatial clustering. At low redshifts (median z≤ 0.5), the comoving correlation length is approximately constant, r\\n0\\n= 6.1 ± 0.5 h\\n−1\\n Mpc, and then decreases with increasing redshift to a value of 2.9 ± 0.3 h\\n−1\\n Mpc for the faintest sample, for which the median redshift is z∼ 1. We suggest that this trend can be attributed to a decrease in the average galaxy and halo mass in the fainter flux‐limited samples, corresponding to changes in the relative numbers of early‐ and late‐type galaxies. However, we cannot rule out strong evolution of the correlation length over 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.</td>\n",

We formulate the optimization problem of resource allocation and power control and we obtain the near-optimal solution by quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) method, in which the quantum particles represent the solutions of resource allocation and power control.

       "      <td>Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the key to natural language processing for the extraction of useful information from the text documents of numerous sources. Several different techniques, i.e., simple rule-based to lexicon-based and more sophisticated machine learning algorithms, have been widely used with different classifiers to get the factual analysis of sentiment. However, lexicon-based sentiment classification is still suffering from low accuracies, mainly due to the deficiency of domain-oriented competitive dictionaries. Similarly, machine learning-based sentiment is also tackling the accuracy constraints because of feature ambiguity from social data. One of the best ways to deal with the accuracy issue is to select the best feature-set and reduce the volume of the feature. This paper proposes a method (namely, GAWA) for feature selection by utilizing the Wrapper Approaches (WA) to select the premier features and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reduce the size of the premier features. The novelty of this work is the modified fitness function of heuristic GA to compute the optimal features by reducing the redundancy for better accuracy. This work aims to present a comprehensive model of hybrid sentiment by using the proposed method, GAWA. It will be valued in developing a new approach for the selection of feature-set with a better accuracy level. The experiments revealed that these techniques could reduce the feature-set up-to 61.95% without negotiating the accuracy level. The new optimal feature sets enhanced the efficiency of the Naïve Bayes algorithm up to 92%. This work is compared with the conventional method of feature selection and concluded the 11% better accuracy than PCA and 8% better than PSO. Furthermore, the results are compared with the literature work and found that the proposed method outperformed the previous research.</td>\n",

The system is generic in that it can be tailored by the system administrator (using XML specifications) for a particular environment of context information inputs and a set of services. In addition, the actual rules that determine which services are triggered by which combination of contextual inputs are determined by the individual user in a user-friendly manner. Thus the generic architecture can be easily deployed for a particular building and an individual user. Generic solutions are sometimes inefficient but this system has been designed to be highly efficient through using an event-based architecture and dealing with time in a special way.

Motivated by Jafar's robust interference alignment technique, we study the so-called staggered multi-antenna block-fading wiretap channel where the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper have different temporal correlation structures. Assuming no CSI at transmitter, we characterize lower and upper bounds on the secrecy degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) of the channel at hand.

Most of the optimizations are based on algorithms and methodologies, which have been developed by the author in-house. This is because traditional techniques cannot handle difficulties due to the large number of components, the requirement of high accuracy, the limitation of tolerance or the need for computer time.

The theory is both simple and intuitive, it is compared with experiments on a parametric amplifier, and a very good agreement is found. Furthermore, using theoretical results, a method to obtain saturation characteristics for parametric amplifiers that have features not easily reproduced by theory is presented. The obtained method finds saturation characteristics in a few steps, providing that the gain studied is above 15 dB, where the approximations upon which our simple expression is based are strictly valid.

Predictions based on dispersion theory for frequencies above 10 Hz fall below experimental data and do not account for wind-speed dependence. The discrepancy may rest either in the linear wave-model or the mechanism. Laboratory measurements of wind waves show low spatial coherence and no evidence of dispersion at high frequencies, suggesting that the surface dynamics are more like convective turbulence than linear waves. While spectral estimates based on this model do not yet account for field data, the effects of nonlinear phenomena noted in the experiments remain to be examined.&lt;\\n&gt;</td>\n",

It is one of the dissemination channels for the Integrated Public Alert and Warnings System (IPAWS). WEA typically broadcasts an alert in the cells with at least some portion affected by the emergency event. When the affected area includes only portions of one or more cells, there could be a high proportion of False Positives (people who should not have been notified get the message on their cell phones) and/or False Negatives (people who should have been notified but are not notified). We propose a scheme that uses the mobile devices' knowledge of their own location and the target area described in the cell broadcast message to filter the messages in the cell phone and notify the user only when the mobile device's estimated location is within the target area. We evaluate the new scheme in terms of false negatives and positives, radio resource requirements, and notification latency, and compare it with various other geotargeting schemes. We also discuss mechanisms to communicate the target area information efficiently in the limited bandwidth available in cellular broadcast channel. Finally, we discuss ways for allowing a broader set of contexts to determine whether a user should be notified of a given emergency.</td>\n",

Ordinal measures, which are based on relative ordering of intensity values in windows, have demonstrable robustness to depth discontinuities, occlusion and noise. The relative ordering of intensity values in each window is represented by a rank permutation which is obtained by sorting the corresponding intensity data. By using a novel distance metric between the rank permutations, we arrive at ordinal correlation coefficients. These coefficients are independent of absolute intensity scale, i.e. they are normalized measures. Further, since rank permutations are invariant to monotone transformations of the intensity values, the coefficients are unaffected by nonlinear effects like gamma variation between images. We have developed a simple algorithm for their efficient implementation. Experiments suggest the superiority of ordinal measures over existing techniques under non-ideal conditions. Though we present ordinal measures in the context of stereo, they serve as a general tool for image matching that is applicable to other vision problems such as motion estimation and image registration.</td>\n",

In this paper, two novel PM tubular machines named partitioned stator interior PM (PS-IPM) and partitioned stator surface-mounted PM (PS-SPM) tubular machines are proposed. Both the proposed machines are optimized for maximum thrust force, and their electromagnetic performance has been compared. It is found that the PS-IPM tubular machine has higher thrust force capability and better magnet utilization compared with the PS-SPM tubular machine. However, due to lower cogging force, the PS-SPM tubular machine has fewer thrust force ripples. Furthermore, the effect of the cross-coupling magnetic saturation on PM flux linkage, and the d-axis and q-axis inductances for both the proposed machines is investigated. It is demonstrated that the PM flux linkage and the d-axis and q-axis inductances are affected by the cross-coupling magnetic saturation. Moreover, the force-velocity characteristics of the proposed machines are calculated and compared. It is observed that both the machines have good constant power operation capability.</td>\n",

In this paper, a novel matrix model for passband OFDM-OQAM signaling with a small number of subcarriers over a multipath frequency selective fading channel is presented. Specifically, in OFDM-OQAM a frequency selective channel is divided into many smaller but still frequency selective overlapping channels, so approximating the frequency response of a subchannel by the channel frequency response sampled at the subcarrier frequency may be inadequate. Channel effects may be better characterized if the frequency response of each subchannel is represented as a Taylor expansion at the subcarrier frequency. Simulation results show how the matrix model implemented by means of this approximation is a suitable model for OFDM-OQAM with a small number of subcarriers.</td>\n",

We applied support vector machine on four types of datasets: 1) Pixel-based Spectral Features (PSF); 2) PSF and Canopy Height Features; 3) Object-based Spectral Features (OSF); and 4) Object-based Spectral Features and Canopy Height Features (OSCHF). The results showed that the full-class classification accuracy from OSCHF was the highest with an overall accuracy of 94.04% and Kappa of 0.91, which was significantly higher than result using OSF, and the accuracy of PSF was the worst. The OSF could eliminate speckle noise problem to some extent, but grapes and trees were still to some extent misclassified as paddy rice due to similar spectrum.

In this paper, we give an analytical upper bound on the required transport capacity for 1+N protection in full-meshed networks with unit traffic demands. Next, we consider networks with uniform and exponentially distributed traffic demands, and derive more realistic bounds for the achievable network performance of 1+N protection in full-meshed networks.We will show analytically that the gains decrease significantly relative to a unit-traffic demand distribution, independent of the protection mechanism used.</td>\n",

Aiming at the system characteristics of HST, a set of integer-order control methods based on the excellent approximation ability of Radial Basis Function Neural Network(RBFNN) are established firstly, and motivated by them, a kind of RBFNN-based fractional-order control methods are proposed by utilizing the genetic attenuation properties of fractional calculus(FC) in order to improve the control performance in the work. It should be pointed out that all the developed methods are able to deal with uncertainties and nonlinearities as well as actuator failures without the need for any “trail and error” process.

We design a distributed average consensus algorithm for estimating the unknown object class by computing the value of the smoothness objective function for different class hypotheses. It initially estimates the objective function locally based on the observation of each sensor. As the distributed consensus algorithm progresses, all observations are gradually taken into account in the estimation of the objective function. We illustrate the performance of the distributed classification algorithm for multiview face recognition in an ad hoc network of vision sensors.

Driver speed control is a complex behavior of longitudinal vehicle control consisting of speed perception, decision making, motor control, vehicle dynamics modeling, and individual driver differences. However, there are few existing models that can integrate all of these aspects in a cohesive manner. To address this problem, this paper introduces a mathematical model for a driver's speed control with analytical solutions based on human cognitive mechanisms in driving. This model includes an integrated queuing network-model human processor structure and the rule-based decision field theory. This new model consequently can predict several aspects of driver speed control behavior at the same time, such as driving speed, throttle/brake pedal angle, acceleration, and the frequency of speedometer inspection. A laboratory session involving a driving simulator is conducted to validate the current model. The model accounted for over 99% of the experimental speed of the average driver, and over 95% of the experimental speed for the majority of individual drivers.</td>\n",

The extra degree of freedom does not significantly alter the conclusions drawn in a previous paper on the shape of the Milky Way's dark matter halo.

Distance of the node from base station, degree of connectivity of the node and trust level of the node is individually analyzed and is linearly combined with weights associated with each parameter. This gives the overall potential function of a node to become a leader. The number of rounds after which leader selection takes place is also equated. Through simulation the algorithm is compared with traditional energy-distance based method for routing protocols LBEERA, OREC, PEGASIS and SHORT. Significant improvement of network lifetime is obtained using this leader selection algorithm. Highest improvement of more than 8% increase in network lifetime is observed when distance of the node from the base station is given a higher linear combination weight.</td>\n",

The safety model is used to calculate the probability and rate of an event leading to the hazard state - situation, where safety of a modeled system is violated, so the system may cause material loss or mortality. The reduction method allows us to prove that the rate of the event is sufficiently small hence the hazard state may be neglected. The real safety model of railway station signaling and interlocking equipments is used as a case study.</td>\n",

Specifically, ABS strategy places more emphasis on such training examples, including positive item with a lower preference score and negative items with a higher preference score for each gradient step. Then, we provide the corresponding proofs for the ABS strategy from both gradient and ranking perspectives. First, we prove that sampled training examples by ABS strategy can update the model parameters with a large magnitude and analyze two instantiations by combining two specific pairwise algorithms. Second, it can be proved that ABS strategy is equivalent to optimizing for ranking-aware evaluation metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Furthermore, ABS strategy can be very general and applicable in a lot of pairwise structures of pairwise algorithms. Based on ABS strategy, we provide an effective sampling algorithm to dynamically draw items for each SGD update. Finally, we evaluate the ABS strategy by conducting sampling tasks in two representative pairwise algorithms. The experiment results show that the ABS strategy performs significantly better than the baseline strategies.</td>\n",

Adiabatic reversible logic was examined in the 1980s and 1990s but in that era power dissipation was a secondary concern, and the trade-off of reduced computational speed for reduced power was deemed unacceptable. Now, power dissipation and the associated heat are the major obstacles limiting progress in integrated circuits, particularly processors. In modern processors trading performance for reduced power dissipation is already done using techniques such as multi-core and dark silicon, so adiabatic logic may now be an attractive approach. To evaluate the adiabatic approach, this paper uses the figure of merit of the product of switching energy, delay time, and area (EDA). Using this figure of merit, adiabatic logic is shown to be advantageous when additional constraints are considered, such as maximum allowed power density. As a proof of concept circuit, a simplified MIPS microprocessor was designed using adiabatic logic based on split-rail charge recovery logic and Bennett clocking. New design and verification tools were developed using structural Verilog and extensions of ModelSim to provide needed capabilities are not available in commercial packages. The design is implemented using a standard cell design.</td>\n",

Within this formulation, saturation constraints on the clutch torque input as well as the positiveness of the slipping speed needed to avoid gear engagement during the slip are effectively handled. A linear model of the actuator-driveline system is employed to cast the underlying MPC optimization problem as a quadratic programme that, thanks to the effective actually available solvers, allows a fast online implementation of the controller on real transmission control unit platforms.

The use of hydrophilic organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (NPs), dispersed in water, enables the simplification of the electrode preparation process at room temperature. In this study, we developed a transparent breadboard and NP microelectrodes in the microfluidic channel to measure the number of particles. The electrode fabrication in the microfluidic channel can be acquired using conventional laboratory equipment without the need for expensive ultra-vacuum deposition instruments. We integrated the equipment with electrical measurement systems to count cells and/or microparticles. By using a parallel electric-circuit model (diluted case) or Langmuir isotherm model (saturated case), the particle concentration between two NP electrodes can be analyzed by measuring the capacitance of the total circuit.

While prior work indicates that mMIMO networks employing time division duplexing have a significant capacity growth potential, deploying mMIMO in frequency division duplexing (FDD) networks remains problematic. The two main difficulties in FDD networks are the scalability of the downlink reference signals and the overhead associated with the required uplink feedback for channel state information (CSI) acquisition. To address these difficulties, most existing methods utilize assumptions on the radio environment such as channel sparsity or angular reciprocity. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative method for a scalable and low-overhead approach to FDD mMIMO under the so-called grid-of-beams architecture. The key idea behind our scheme lies in the exploitation of the near-common signal propagation paths that are often found across several mobile users located in nearby regions, through a coordination mechanism. In doing so, we leverage the recently specified device-to-device communications capability in 5G networks. Specifically, we design beam selection algorithms capable of striking a balance between CSI acquisition overhead and multi-user interference mitigation. The selection exploits statistical information, through so-called covariance shaping. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which prove particularly well-suited to rapidly-varying channels with short coherence time.</td>\n",

A data-aided adaptive detection at the BS starting directly in a tracking mode thanks to pre-equalization can compensate for the increasing mismatch between channel pre-equalization and actual channel response caused by large velocities all along the uplink frame.

A proposed socio-ecological energy system (SEES) framework used to characterize the core-level subsystems (resources, users, and governance) in terms of second-level and deeper level variables is motivated by the more general multilevel nested socio-ecological system (SES) framework. Second-level and deeper level variables are introduced as a means of characterizing how sustainable a SEES is likely to be by assessing their characteristics. Given vast spatial and temporal complexities in a typical SEES, it becomes necessary to enhance the physical power network with just-in-time (JIT), just-in-place (JIP), and just-in-context (JIC) functionalities. These, in turn, support sustainable energy services by aligning temporal, spatial, and contextual characteristics of resources and users. We refer to the ICT implementation in support of these functionalities as dynamic monitoring and decision systems (DYMONDS). The tradeoffs between the ability of the SEES to ensure sustainable services and the complexity of the supporting smart grid are discussed for several representative energy system architectures.</td>\n",

The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulation results on the head-positioning servo control system of a hard disk drive (HDD) during track-following mode, where no external PE signal is added on.</td>\n",

The results show that books recommended by collaborative filtering were least favorably evaluated, followed by those recommended by association rule and Amazon. Collaborative filtering carries the risk of breaching users' privacy and its computational costs are higher compared to those of association rule mining. Therefore, if we recommend books based on library loan records, association rule mining should be adopted instead of collaborative filtering.

A practical use case, in which the proposed system is used for delivering drugs (an application in which the need to quickly receive the good might be particularly important) is shown.

Designs in which the diode ohmic anode has an overhanging Schottky extension (composite anode contact) are shown to result in a significantly reduced amount of impact ionization, as compared with a simple ohmic contact design. The EL results are consistent with Monte Carlo simulations, which show a reduced impact ionization in composite anode contact devices due to a reduced electron density beneath the anode Schottky extension that, on the one hand, weakens the Gunn domain electric field and softens its variations near the anode edge, and, on the other hand, reduces the number of electrons capable of generating holes by impact ionization. A comparison between standard and composite anode contact approaches in terms of radio-frequency operation of the devices is made showing oscillations up to 109 GHz with an output power of -5 dBm in devices featuring the composite anode contact and no oscillations from all-ohmic contact devices. The findings reported in this paper may be useful not only for the design and the fabrication of planar Gunn diodes but also for other devices such as high-electron-mobility transistors where impact ionization can result in reliability limitations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A promising ultra-wideband (UWB) radio technique being widely considered for low-data-rate applications, such as those often encountered in sensor networks, is the transmitted reference (TR) UWB scheme. However, the standard TR-UWB scheme, while often motivated by the simplicity of its receiver, is still dogged by implementation concerns. In particular, the receiver requires an extremely wideband delay element, which is difficult to incorporate into low-power integrated systems. In this paper, a TR scheme is proposed in which the separation between the data and reference signals, rather than being a time delay, is a slow rotation over the symbol interval. This provides a (slightly) frequency-shifted reference that, while orthogonal to the data-bearing pulse, still goes through a nearly equal channel. A detailed analysis of the proposed scheme is provided. Simulation results demonstrate the expected result that frequency shifting of the reference in the proposed manner is not effective for high-data-rate systems that experience appreciable intersymbol interference. However, for the targeted low-to-moderate data-rate applications, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system not only achieves the primary goal of providing a much simpler receiver architecture, but also that it outperforms the standard TR-UWB system</td>\n",

Performance was compared to a hidden Markov model (HMM) in small-vocabulary ASR experiments with additive noise. Accuracy of 50% was achieved by a discriminative ESN classifier at -8.5 dB SNR, compared to 0.4 dB SNR for a predictive ESN classifier and 6.6 dB SNR for an HMM.

Specifically, we explore reactions and interactions of persons facing a mobile robot from a robot centric view. This new perspective offers social awareness to the robots, enabling interesting applications. As far as we know, there is no public 3D dataset for this problem. Therefore, we record two multi-modal first-person RGBD datasets that reflect the setting we are analyzing. We use a humanoid and a non-humanoid robot equipped with a Kinect. Notably, the videos contain a high percentage of ego-motion due to the robot self-exploration as well as its reactions to the persons' interactions. We show that separating the descriptors extracted from ego-motion and independent motion areas, and using them both, allows us to achieve superior recognition results. Experiments show that our algorithm recognizes the activities effectively and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on related tasks.</td>\n",

The active current distribution on the entire array geometry is then obtained by solving these smaller matrix equations pertaining to the elements. The active impedance matrix calculation entails a summation of the MoM matrix diagonal and off-diagonal sub-matrices. For arrays containing a large number of elements this summation can lead to matrix fill times similar to that of the global MoM calculation. To mitigate this significant computational overhead, while still maintaining a sufficient degree of accuracy, the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) algorithm is applied to accelerate this part of the DGFM.</td>\n",

Conducting interfaces can, for instance, be used to describe a 2-D electron gas or a planar metamaterial.

However, along the route, the signals experience different physical layer impairments (PLIs), and their quality also worsens. The transmission signal quality is affected by the launch power, which must be high for lesser noise at the receiver, and must also be low, such that the PLIs do not start to distort the signal. Further, higher launch power also disrupts the existing lightpath and its neighbours. We propose a weighted strategy for provisioning PLI-aware (PLI-A) lightpaths in MLR networks.

Drucker (1993) said that knowledge would be the only competitive resource for companies in the future. This is an era in which knowledge plays a dominant role in our daily business lives. Intellectual capital has gradually taken the place of traditional tangible capital in many business organizations. However, practitioners are often puzzled about where they stand, how well they are doing, and what they should do next. This paper aims to construct a knowledge management maturity model as a means to help answer these and related questions. There are three components in the proposed model: maturity levels, knowledge management processes, and knowledge management capabilities or enabling infrastructures. The maturity levels are based on the capability maturity model (CMM) of SEI. This model divides the knowledge management process into four main sub-processes: knowledge creation, knowledge storage, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application, emphasizing the need for continuous process improvement. Furthermore, knowledge management enablers are integrated into KMMM to describe how it supports the practices at each maturity level. The applicability of this model is evaluated through case studies, which also serve to illustrate how knowledge management practices among organizations are compared, and what maturity paths organizations can follow. Three banks were taken for cases study through in depth interview with their senior managements. By analyzing data gathered through the process described above, the conclusion of this study is induced.</td>\n",

       "      <td>To design a new model to reduce the noise of a reactor under inverter power supply, the cause of noise should be investigated. We carry out vibration analysis of a single phase of a reactor while considering electromagnetism and magnetostriction to clarify the mechanism of noise generation in the reactor. In this analysis, magnetostriction is modeled three-dimensionally with equivalent nodal forces. First, the nodal forces in the cores of reactor due to the electromagetism and magnetostriction are calculated using the flux distribution obtained from magnetic field analysis. To determine the dominant cause of noise, the spatial distributions of displacements generated by both nodal forces are then obtained by static structure analysis and they are compared in detail. Moreover, the actual movements of the cores are calculated by vibration analysis. Finally, the effect of the hardness of the cores on noise generation is calculated and measured. It is shown that the hardness of the insulator inserted in gaps between cores affects the vibration and it seems to have an optimal value. Moreover, the analyzed results are proved by measurement.</td>\n",

EEG signals were recorded from three reference electrodes (Fz, C3, and C4) and from six additional electrodes located close to the reference electrodes. The performance of four different feature extraction methods [power spectral density (PSD), phase locking value (PLV), a combination of PSD and PLV, and cross-correlation (CC)] were evaluated in terms of robustness to electrode location changes as well as regarding absolute classification accuracy. The quantitative evaluation results demonstrated that the use of either PSD- or CC-based features led to higher classification accuracy than the use of PLV-based features, whereas PSD-based features showed much higher sensitivity to changes in EEG electrode location than CC- or PLV-based features. There results suggest that CC can be a promising feature extraction method in motor-imagery-based BCI studies as it provides high classification accuracy along with being little affected by slight changes in the EEG electrode locations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In comparison with silicon IGBT, silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET is expected to reduce the switching loss and the conduction loss and to remove external freewheeling diodes (FWDs). However, its body diode has comparatively high forward voltage; therefore, the diode conduction loss generated during dead time increases. As a result, the loss reduction by the use of the SiC MOSFET can be weakened. This paper proposes a simple dead-time controller integrated in an isolated gate driver in order to reduce the diode conduction loss during the dead time. The proposed method has high speed and high robustness against switching noise by using of a current-sense FET with small parasitic capacitance. As a result, the diode conduction time can be shortened within 0.1 μs. In addition, the proposed dead-time control method can be achieved by existing components, including the current-sense FET, which is currently used for short-circuit current detection in hybrid vehicle applications. The proposed method was applied to a 10 kW boost converter with SiC MOSFET. The experimental results showed 1% higher efficiency of the converter with the proposed dead-time-controlled gate driver compared to that without dead-time control circuit, and the efficiency was the similar level as when a SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) was used as FWDs.</td>\n",

So the cache hit rate has a significant impact on the performance of the application. Many processors provide cache locking mechanism, which can lock the certain lines in cache. It enables an application to affect the cache replacement decisions under software control. This paper presents a novel method, which uses cache locking mechanism to reduce the run-time of java virtual machine (JVM). JVM often uses just-in-time compiler (JIT) to improve the performance. JIT compiles the method that has been invoked certain times, and then JVM executes the compiled method when invoking this method the next time. This paper analyzes the calling situation of the compiled method in JVM, and then proposes a heuristic approach to lock the compiled method in cache for an appropriate period. It can reduce cache miss rate when JVM executes the compiled method. The algorithm has been implemented in HotSpot based on Loongson-3A. Also, it can be implemented in other run-time systems. Experiment results show that the cache locking heuristic algorithm averagely reduces the cache miss rate by 8.5%, and improves the performance by 4% on the benchmark SPECjvm2008.</td>\n",

Our model treats the class label as a global description of the image, and treats annotation terms as local descriptions of parts of the image. Its underlying probabilistic assumptions naturally integrate these two sources of information. We derive an approximate inference and estimation algorithms based on variational methods, as well as efficient approximations for classifying and annotating new images. We examine the performance of our model on two real-world image data sets, illustrating that a single model provides competitive annotation performance, and superior classification performance.</td>\n",

Results: The error rates of the Interactive Double Data Entry verification was 15.17 per 10,000 data items (fields). The error rate of the consistent verification was 1.18 per 10,000 data items (fields).

Conclusions: The error rates of the consistency check were lower than the interactive verification under the same condition, interactive verification was more suitable for data in large clinical research, limited time and case analyzing required right after verification.

On the one hand, perceptual learning is more and more studied in neurobiology and is now considered as an essential part of any living system. In fact, perceptual learning and cognitive learning are both necessary for learning and often depend on each other. On the other hand, many works in machine learning are concerned with \"abstraction\" in order to reduce the amount of complexity related to some learning tasks. In the abstraction framework, perceptual learning can be seen as a specific process that learns how to transform the data before the traditional learning task itself takes place. In this paper, we argue that biologically inspired perceptual learning mechanisms could be used to build efficient low-level abstraction operators that deal with real-world data. To illustrate this, we present an application where perceptual-learning-inspired metaoperators are used to perform an abstraction on an autonomous robot visual perception. The goal of this work is to enable the robot to learn how to identify objects it encounters in its environment.</td>\n",

Therefore in this paper, an algorithm is proposed for evaluating the average hop count and illustrates the effect of hop count on path reliability for various scenario metrics such as network size, network coverage area, transmission range of the mobile nodes considering mobility of mobile nodes. The methodology uses Random Way Point Mobility Model to locate the spatial distribution of mobile nodes.

       "      <td>Cognitive radio (CR) is regarded as a key technology to solve the scarcity of spectrum resources and improve spectrum utilization. Spectrum sensing is one of the basic components of CR technology. Energy sensing, matched filtering sensing and cyclostationary sensing are three classical methods for spectrum sensing in CR networks, but all of them still have some defects. In this paper, phototropism in biology is introduced and “light source” model is established for spectrum sensing in CR networks, and a new spectrum sensing technology is researched based on the phototropism. After comparing the commonness and difference between plant growth and spectrum sensing process, a multi-threshold spectrum sensing algorithm based on the phototropism principle for cognitive radio is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the performance of the spectrum sensing in CR networks, compared with three classical methods.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In global air traffic management (ATM), it is necessary to exchange various information related to aircraft operation such as the flight plans, surveillance, airports, weather, and restrictions, among different systems and operators. Hence, the concept of System Wide Information Management (SWIM) has been promoted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to implement interoperability and harmonization in global operation. In the SWIM environment, all the related stakeholders need to efficiently obtain the necessary ATM data with situational awareness from various information domains. However, this is difficult to realize in the current system, as different data are structured based on different data models. In this study, we construct domain ontologies based on flight, aeronautical, and weather information exchange models. Further, we develop a common ontology that uniformly defines the inconsistent representation in terms of the 4D, 3D, and 2D concepts and their inclusion relations and propose an integration method for heterogeneous domain ontologies. Moreover, we apply the proposed ontologies to a SWIM test system. The applicability and efficiency of the proposal are demonstrated through a case study in the SWIM environment.</td>\n",

A better model of the short circuit power is used which takes into account the loading capacitance of the gates. Our results show that the combination of VS and GS perform better than the techniques applied in isolation. An average power reduction of 73% is obtained when decisions are taken assuming dynamic power only.

       "      <td>Control of nonlinear under-actuated systems is an area of ongoing research. In certain applications, under- actuated systems are unavoidable. For instance, a biped can not have an actuator between the foot and the ground. In industrial robots, under-actuation can minimize cost and dead weight. Differential flatness, if applicable, provides a systematic approach to plan and control feasible trajectories for such systems. Recently, the authors have formulated a philosophy to design under-actuated planar manipulators that are differentially flat [1]. The design philosophy has two sufficient conditions: (i) an inertia distribution scheme, and (ii) an actuator and torque spring placement scheme. The philosophy covers a broad range of n-DOF manipulator designs with the degree of under- actuation varying from 1 to n - 1 as opposed to under-actuation by one or two in most of the literature on under-actuated manipulators. This paper presents a 3-DOF planar manipulator designed on the basis of this philosophy and an experimental study of controllers based on its differential flatness property. It is demonstrated experimentally that the differential flatness based controllers are able to track the desired trajectories with small tracking errors even in the presence disturbances like friction, parameter uncertainty etc. It is shown via simulation that the errors observed in the trajectories can be attributed to the friction present at the unactuated joint.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Limit-cycle or self-oscillating power amplifiers (SOPAs) are seen as an effective and simple option to achieve linear yet efficient power amplification. Unfortunately, they suffer from unfiltered switching noise, also known as ripple, whose amplitude increases for progressively lower self-oscillating frequency. Moreover, such self-oscillating frequency changes with the input signal and its dependency curve, as well as its maximum, are determined by the overall loop delay and by the open-loop filter. To remedy this SOPAs' pitfall, this paper presents a method to increase the self-oscillation frequency and reduce frequency modulation for a fixed propagation delay and loop filter. This is achieved using a relay that exhibits a novel kind of hysteresis. For that, the theory of its working principle will be discussed in detail, its transfer characteristic will be defined, and an implementation suitable for VLSI will be proposed. To validate the concept, simulations and an experimental prototype were carried out to compare the behavior of existing types of SOPA with the proposed one.</td>\n",

Several Electronic Travel Aids are proposed in the literature, and the methodology is evaluated by placing different types of the obstacle, traveling through them blindfolded, and counting the number of times obstacles are detected or not by the system. In our view, this approach helps little for further advancing the current system as the experimental scenario is not repeatable entirely and makes it difficult to compare new research findings with any existing one. We therefore, present a model inspired by the real world settings for detecting low-lying obstacles, considering few assumptions and constraints. The simulations are also proposed based on the model to generate obstacle data any number of time. Furthermore, to validate our model and simulations, field experiments are conducted, and the results obtained are compared with the simulation result. The evaluation parameter in terms of standard deviation, accuracy, false positive, errors encountered suggest that the proposed model and simulations effectively encapsulates the real-world parameters and thus can be explored and utilized further by the research community.</td>\n",

The GPSM scheme proposed recently is a new multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmission technique, which conveys information by activating a subset of receive antennas with the aid of transmit pre-coding. This scheme seems to be suitable in V2X since the base station only transmits data to certain users/vehicles. The proposed pre-coding matrix is based on the lattice reduction (LR) principle and provides significant performance improvement over the original pre-coding design in GPSM. Furthermore, as the GPSM in large-scale antenna systems, which is a trend in future communication systems, might be too complex to be implemented with the maximum likelihood (ML) detection, a linear decoding method is proposed to reduce the implementation complexity. Our studies show that the performance degradation caused by the linear detector can be compensated by the proposed LR based pre-coding. As a result, the LR based GPSM with linear detection is capable of achieving the comparable performance as that of the original GPSM scheme employing ML detection, while with significantly decreased detection complexity.</td>\n",

These include a global GEO MSS system, Inmarsat, and domestic GEO MSS systems such as North-American AMSC, Japan's N-Star and the Australian Mobilesat. At present, two types of antennas can be used to access GEO MSS services. They include (1) fixed position antennas, which are used with portable transceivers; and (2) fully mobile antennas such as those installed on a land vehicle. The fixed position antennas are relatively easy to design, as they have to meet a moderate (approximately 7%) operational bandwidth and a medium (about 10 dBi) gain. There are a number of complete portable systems in the commercial market that include both a transceiver and an antenna. One inconvenience of portable systems is that they require the user be stationary with respect to the ground. This inconvenience can be overcome with a mobile antenna system. The design of such a system is more challenging as new features associated with mobility have to be incorporated. This paper presents the development and performance of a circular phased array antenna for land vehicle mobile satellite communications. This antenna is specifically aimed for use with the Australian MSS, Mobilesat. However, it can easily be modified for use with the other L-band GEO MSS systems.</td>\n",

Potential applications for GSVD-based beamforming can be found in MIMO broadcasting, as well as in MIMO relaying under all amplify-and-forward, decode-and-forward, and code-and-forward relay processing schemes.

The self-designed single-mode generator is constructed in the form of a matrix of acoustic monopoles and is capable to generate a selected single mode. The scattering matrix formalism is a new approach to analyse the acoustical systems containing one or more duct-like elements (joints) connected by some undefined elements such as, for example, acoustic mufflers of different types and so the formalism is frequently applied to analyse the phenomena of noise reduction in such systems. Experimental derivation of the scattering matrix for a wave composed of N modes demands, in general, excitation of N different sound fields at each side of the two-port first. Finally the matrix composed of the modal pressures measurements obtained for each of the exited fields must be inversed to obtain the scattering matrix. Generating single N modes the matrix of the incoming pressure data is, theoretically, diagonal which makes derivation of the scattering matrix much easier. Generation of independent sound fields in the shape of single modes ensures the matrix to be well conditioned.</td>\n",

Although NASA's Human-Powered Lunar Rover Design Competition was used as the \"vehicle\" for the course development, the main impetus was to provide a true multidisciplinary design experience for both engineering and nonengineering students. Groups of students from the different majors were formed to design and analyze major components of the Lunar Rover. Teamwork within and between the groups was emphasized since the various components had to be integrated to form the final design. An interesting aspect of the course was to treat the two human drivers as one of the major components. This resulted in a complete engineering analysis of the performance characteristics of the students to determine the best choice of drivers (i.e., \"engines\"). To enhance the multidisciplinary experience, technical assistance and/or financial support was provided by the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Science Department as well as the Geology and Exercise Science Departments. The students completed the design, built the rover, and successfully participated in the NASA sponsored competition. Despite an initial hesitance to work with students outside their major, the class came together as a team. The course objectives and structure, results of the design process and competition, lessons learned, and future course developments are discussed in this paper.</td>\n",

One example is the IBM POWER5TM processor, a two-context simultaneous-multithreaded dual-core chip. In each SMT core, the IBM POWER5 features two levels of thread resource balancing and prioritization. The first level provides automatic in-hardware resource balancing, while the second level is a software-controlled priority mechanism that presents eight levels of thread priorities. Currently, software-controlled prioritization is only used in limited number of cases in the software platforms due to lack of performance characterization of the effects of this mechanism. In this work, we characterize the effects of the software-based prioritization on several different workloads. We show that the impact of the prioritization significantly depends on the workloads coscheduled on a core. By prioritizing the right task, it is possible to obtain more than two times of throughput improvement for synthetic workloads compared to the baseline. We also present two application case studies targeting two different performance metrics: the first case study improves overall throughput by 23.7% and the second case study reduces the total execution time by 9.3%.

       "      <td>We demonstrate a standalone (no global clock) receiver for two-dimensional wavelength-time optical code-division multiple-access. The receiver provides the following functions: quantization (to eliminate multiple access interference), clock and data recovery, return-to-zero to nonreturn-to-zero conversion (for optical code-division multiple-access compatibility with digital logic), framing (for byte synchronization), and forward-error correction (FEC) using a (255, 239) Reed-Solomon decoder. The receiver more than doubles the number of supported users at a bit-error rate &lt;10\\n-10\\n. The receiver supports an information rate of 156.25 Mb/s. We performed the measurements at a bit rate of 167.4 Mb/s and a chip rate of 1.339 Gb/s (eight chips per bit) to account for FEC overhead</td>\n",

In this study, they discuss the implementation of the PEEMD and its application for the analysis of Earth science data, including the solution of the Lorenz model, an idealized terrain-induced flow, and Hurricane Sandy.   \n",

Many have proposed or are studying innovative systems to perform taxi without use of the main engines. This would result in cleaner and quieter airport operations, as well as in improved fuel efficiency. In this paper, the possibilities and limitations of such systems are discussed considering real scenarios and constraints. The technical challenges that determine their viability and integrability into the aircraft or airport, as well as the expected benefits and issues are addressed. Finally, the most important current research and development projects are presented.   \n",

A neural network approach to online learning control and real-time implementation for a flexible microactuator is presented. The flexible microactuator is made of a bimorph piezoelectric high-polymer material (poly vinylidene fluoride). The bimorph piezoelectric microactuator consists of two PVDF films cemented with a metal shim in proper polarity. When a voltage is applied across the elements, the upper layer elongates, while the lower contracts producing a deflection. The control scheme consists of a feedforward neural network controller and a fixed-gain PID controller. This neural network controller is trained so as to make the output of the PID controller zero. In the process, the neural network learns the inverse dynamics of the system. The feedback-error-learning controller is implemented using a digital signal processor, and experimental results are given.   \n",

Our proposed algorithm estimates both the first- and the second-order sensitivities of the objective function with respect to all considered parameters using at most n+1 extra simulations, where n is the number of parameters. If sensitivity analysis is performed using conventional finite-difference approximations, O(n\\n2\\n) simulations would be required. Our approach is illustrated through an example where a 12-by-12 Hessian matrix of the return loss is computed over a wideband of frequencies. Good match is achieved between our numerically-produced adjoint results and exact analytical results.   \n",

The proposed approach can be applied to both linear and nonlinear designs. By analyzing the resulting sensitivity values, the proposed procedure is able to determine an appropriate distinct word-length for each internal variable. Also in this paper, the power optimizing capabilities of word-length optimization are studied for the first time. Application of the proposed procedure to adaptive filters realized in a Xilinx Virtex FPGA (field programmable gate array) has resulted in area reductions of up to 80% combined with power reductions of up to 98% and speed-up of up to 36% over common alternative design strategies.   \n",

The CSI estimation algorithm based on adaptive compressed sensing (CS) is an efficient method. However, the imperfect multi-resolution hierarchical codebook design possibly leads to wrong detections of angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD), which has a negative effect on the spectral efficiency. In this paper, an enhanced multi-resolution hierarchical codebook design is proposed to realize precise AoD/AoA estimation. First, the necessary number of sampling angles for generating the codebook is given. Then, the algorithm of iterative adjustment (IA) is developed to improve the codebook design. Simulation results show that using the proposed codebook design, the beams can precisely divide the AoA/AoD intervals as the requirements of the adaptive CS based algorithm. Thus, the average angle estimation error is reduced effectively.   \n",

Although individually small, when accumulated over an operating cycle, the voltage deviations are sufficient to distort the applied PWM signal. This paper presents a new method to correct for the dead time deviations. The pulse based compensator is less hardware and software intensive than other dead time compensation methods providing a low cost solution. The pulse based technique is developed by analyzing the effects of dead time on a pulse by pulse basis and correcting each pulse accordingly. The technique is evaluated through simulation and experimental results. Other compensation methods are evaluated and the results compared with the pulse based technique. This comparison indicates previous methods can produce magnitude and phase errors in the applied terminal voltage, whereas the proposed method compensates for the dead time without significant magnitude and phase errors in the terminal voltage of PWM voltage source inverters.   \n",

As GPU-enabled CNNs move into safety-critical environments, reliability is becoming a growing concern. In this paper, we evaluate and propose strategies to improve the reliability of object detection algorithms, as run on three NVIDIA GPU architectures. We consider three algorithms: 1) you only look once; 2) a faster region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN); and 3) a residual network, exposing live hardware to neutron beams. We complement our beam experiments with fault injection to better characterize fault propagation in CNNs. We show that a single fault occurring in a GPU tends to propagate to multiple active threads, significantly reducing the reliability of a CNN. Moreover, relying on error correcting codes dramatically reduces the number of silent data corruptions (SDCs), but does not reduce the number of critical errors (i.e., errors that could potentially impact safety-critical applications). Based on observations on how faults propagate on GPU architectures, we propose effective strategies to improve CNN reliability. We also consider the benefits of using an algorithm-based fault-tolerance technique for matrix multiplication, which can correct more than 87% of the critical SDCs in a CNN, while redesigning maxpool layers of the CNN to detect up to 98% of critical SDCs.   \n",

View synthesis methods introduce localized artifacts when creating new virtual views. Evaluating these methods require therefore a different approach, in order to identify and emphasize synthesis artifact prone areas, while diminishing the impact, of other types of artifacts, such as those produced by quantization during the video coding. In this paper, we propose an artifact evaluation technique which was shown to provide a better differentiation of synthesis methods, while additional information can be extrapolated from the results about the spatial localization of typical synthesis artifacts and their impact on overall image quality.   \n",

For phase-conductors protection against lightning most of these lines include in their configuration one or two grounded earth wires. The presence of these wires naturally leads to a modification of line parameters and concomitantly to an alteration of the line imbalance. In this paper we analyze how the imbalance depends on the earth wires position; more specifically, our goal is to find out whether an optimal positioning for the earth wires exists such that line imbalance minimization can be achieved. Application examples provided in the paper focus on horizontal line configurations.   \n",

The GP-WADV method aims to find the point closest to the obstacle on the link of the manipulator and attach the additional deviation velocity with weighting factors to the point on the basis of the gradient projection method. Utilizing multi-solution characteristics of redundant robots, obstacle avoidance control parameters related to the distance between obstacles and links are proposed according to the gradient projection method for solving inverse kinematic solution. Moreover, a weighted method is adopted to adjust the weighting factors of the primary motion velocity and the additional motion velocity when the link approaches the obstacle, so as to obtain the joint angle solutions more quickly and accurately. The GP-WADV method can ensure that the manipulator can avoid obstacles smoothly without turbulence and solve the highly nonlinear relationship between the position of the manipulator and the joint coordinate, which has the advantages of small amount of calculation, more flexible and convenient real-time control. The advantages of the proposed GP-WADV method are proved by simulation and experiments.   \n",

Modeling the reliability growth of defects for each type separately allows identification of problems in the development process which may otherwise be masked when defects of all types are modeled together. The authors incorporate dependencies, from a failure detection point of view, between defects of two different types into a model for reliability growth. They use typed defect data from three different software projects to validate the model. They find that the defect detection rates are not equal for defects of different types within the project. Since each defect type can be associated with a software development stage, comparing the estimated defect detection rates and the dependency between types provides a basis for feedback on the process.<\\n>   \n",

Using labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, the proposed semi-supervised SOINN (ssSOINN) can automatically learn the topology of input data distribution without any prior knowledge such as the number of nodes or a good network structure; it can subsequently divide the structure into sub-structures as the need arises. Experimental results we obtained for artificial data and real-world data show that the ssSOINN has superior performance for separating data distributions with high-density overlap and that ssSOINN Classifier (S3C) is an efficient classifier.   \n",

The scope of 'dynamic scheduling' treated includes online dynamic change of some scheduling parameters such as rules for part dispatching, machine selection, or routing. IF-THEN-type heuristic operators are utilized to perform this online real-time rule selection, and offline machine learning is used to obtain more detailed and powerful heuristics than those implemented by human experts or programmers. A learning algorithm has been developed to formulate operators that can treat quantity-type as well as quality-type information. A prototype computer program named learning aided dynamic scheduler (LADS) has been developed. A simulation study using LADS indicates good results for dynamic scheduling.<\\n>   \n",

The varieties were Handao502 and Shengdao13. The effect of different concentration Stevioside glycosides blending liquid (SBL) on the yield and quality were studied. The best concentration and method of SBL were discussed. The result of the experiment showed: the appropriate spraying concentrations of SBL on upland and irrigated rice can enhance the grain per ear and the percentage of grain filling and then improve the grain yield up to 13.8% in upland rice and 9.4% in irrigated rice, decrease the amylase content of upland rice and irrigated rice, and reduce the gelatinization temperature, and improve the crude protein content of brown rice and the nutritional quality of rice, thus enhance the cooking and eating quality rice. It can improve the quality of appearance because the chalky rice rate and chalkiness degree decreased. Thus, appropriate spraying concentrations of SBL can improve the economic quality of rice and increase the economic benefit of the farmer.   \n",

All the films found to be fully amorphous in structure were continuous with uniform thickness and surface morphology. Their optical transmittance in the range 50%-85% was found to be film thickness dependent over the entire visible regime. The Verdet constant (V) and Faraday rotation angle (θ\\nf\\n ) for different films (~4-18 nm) investigated as a function of wavelength (λ) show considerably higher values for the films of Fe-B-Nb-Y alloy as compared with those for Fe-B-Nb films, e.g., the ~4 nm film of Fe-B-Nb-Y alloy exhibits V ~ 49°/Oe cm and θ\\nf\\n ~ 26°/μm while it decreased to ~29.4°/Oe and ~11.8°/μm, respectively, for the Fe-B-Nb alloy at λ = 611 nm. A linear relationship is found for the wavelength dependence of V and θ\\nf\\n for both alloy systems. To the best of our knowledge, these values are considerably higher than those reported for any other magneto-optic material. The films are found to be soft magnetic with a high saturation moment while their magnetic coercivity values increases with thinness of the films. The observed combination of optical and magneto-optical properties of this new class of amorphous metallic films makes them viable for multifunctional magneto-optical applications.   \n",

This is a specialized version of the MIMO Y channel where, in the multiple access phase, three users send all messages simultaneously to the relay, and, in the broadcast phase, the relay transmits messages to users also on a single MIMO channel access. Specifically, in the proposed signal alignment (SA) schemes, we design precoding and nulling vectors to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance. In addition to SA constraints, we introduce the orthogonality requirements between spatial signaling dimensions or utilize degrees of freedom in selecting precoding vectors to maximize distances between signaling points representing network coded messages and unicast data.   \n",

Push-To-Talk (PTT) is the core service operation for PoC. This paper analyzes the service requirements for PTT and find it can be modeled as the problem of Delay and delay Variation Bounded Multicasting Network (DVBMN). We designed an algorithm named Faster CHAINS (FCHAINS) for DVBMN, and based on it a new more scalable user plane architecture for PoC is proposed. Compared with the PoC's user plane architecture standardized by Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), the new user plane architecture is more scalable and has better end-to-end delay performance for PTT service.   \n",

The aim is to investigate the use of advanced image analysis techniques to objectively assess and reliably characterize spinal cord motor neurite interactions with human bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) in an in vitro spinal cord injury model which has been developed recently. The principal goal is to better understand the mechanism responsible for neuronal growth and regeneration that are believed to be responsible for the functional improvements noted following cell transplantation for the treatment of lesions to the central nervous system.   \n",

The research and development of flexible physiological sensing technology is in the ascendant. With the development of materials technology, textile technology, sensor technology, energy consumption technology, communication technology and telemedicine technology, and improvement of relevant standards, regulations and regulations, the popularity of flexible wearable physiological monitoring equipment will become a trend. Combining the basic technical characteristics of the core wireless sensor network node and the characteristics of big data, the node architecture is established and optimized on this basis, which makes the whole sensor network become a kind of intelligent network. With these technological support, this paper proposes the novel framework for the analysis of the human physiological detection system. The performance is validated through the core experimental analysis.   \n",

Theory indicates that the required antenna dimensions depend on the load impedance seen by the antenna. It is also seen that the axial ratio bandwidth of the antenna can be varied by correct choice of load impedance. Typical results of antennas designed to operate at 2.450 GHz indicate a broadening of the 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth from approximately 19 MHz with a load impedance of R/sub L/=1.0 M Omega to a value in excess of 130 MHz for R/sub L/=50 Omega .<\\n>   \n",

Large photocurrent and optical response enhancement are achieved over a conventional p-i-n Ge photodetector, which is predominantly attributed to the current gain induced by transistor actions. When illuminated with a photon wavelength of 1.55 mum , a Ge phototransistor shows a large responsivity of ~ 2.0 A/W for a low operating bias \\nVA\\n of 1.0 V. Optical measurement results further show that good photoresponse could be achieved for a spectral range of 1.31-1.62 mum, making such a device a very promising option for optical detections in the near-infrared (including \\nL\\n -band) wavelength regime.   \n",

It will enable viewers to move freely in a dynamic real world scene. Depth image based rendering algorithms will play a pivotal role when synthesizing an arbitrary number of novel views by using a subset of captured views and corresponding depth maps only. Usually, each depth map is estimated individually by stereo-matching algorithms and, hence, shows lack of inter-view consistency. This inconsistency affects the quality of view synthesis negatively. This paper enhances the inter-view consistency of multiview depth imagery. First, our approach classifies the color information in the multiview color imagery by modeling color with a mixture of Dirichlet distributions where the model parameters are estimated in a Bayesian framework with variational inference. Second, using the resulting color clusters, we classify the corresponding depth values in the multiview depth imagery. Each clustered depth image is subject to further sub-clustering. Finally, the resulting mean of each sub-cluster is used to enhance the depth imagery at multiple viewpoints. Experiments show that our approach improves the average quality of virtual views by up to 0.8 dB when compared to views synthesized by using conventionally estimated depth maps.   \n",

Publish/subscribe communications protocols play an important part in such low-powered device communications with MQTT protocol being most prevalent for such deployments. These protocols have enabled IoT applications such as smart home, fleet management, oil pipelines and space exploration that heavily depend on reliable communications. This paper investigates utilization of MQTT protocol for a smart home security system. A Raspberry Pi implementation detects an intrusion event using a passive infrared sensor triggering an image capture which is then communicated to the subscribed client for countermeasures. Results for power consumption and data transfer are provided that help understand the behaviour with different service qualities.   \n",

Since the high dimension of observation data, sparse feature learning plays an important role in overcoming the challenge of high variable dimension and low sample size problem among the disease identification. In this paper, sparse Elastic Net (EN) was used to extract low dimension features and to identify the Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compare with principal component analysis (PCA) method, the EN method can solve the problems of less samples and high correlations between variables. For those variables sharing the same biological phenomenon, it selected whole groups into the model automatically once one variable among them was selected. Unlike other subspace learning methods, the proposed method used less man-made feature setting. The problems of dimension reduction and classification were conducted into a similar formulation. Experimental results illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.   \n",

The latter requires that the muons be accelerated as rapidly as possible to prevent particle loss. The former allows one to loop back and pass through the same linac multiple times, thereby achieving potentially significant cost advantages. Some of the acceleration systems will use recirculating linacs to achieve the reuse of the accelerating structures. However, the large longitudinal beam emittances make it difficult to simultaneously achieve large gradients by using high frequency RF and design an arc with a sufficient energy acceptance. The current state of the design for the acceleration stages for a muon collider is presented, with emphasis on systems accelerating to 70 GeV per beam. Known difficulties will be described as will their possible solutions. In particular, the use of an FFAG-like lattice for the arcs of a recirculating linac is described which accepts a beam with a very large energy spread over a wide range of energies, allowing a single are to be used instead of multiple arcs.   \n",

A novel form of frequency response expression of digital filters is deduced which is sum of sinc sum functions. One of the remarkable characteristics of the form is that weights(coefficients of terms) of window functions can be directly calculated according to the expression. An example for how to find a window function is illustrated in detail. An instance of series of window functions is tabled with both window weights and filter performances. Stopband attenuation of filters is from 32 db to 63 db with the gap about 3 db. With same performances of stopband attenuation and transition width both the order and passband ripple of filters using the new method is little better than that using Kaiser window if passband attenuation is smaller than 50 db and little worse if bigger than 52 db. The obtained window functions are as simple as Blackman window function. The outstanding feature of the new approach is that it can provide a very efficient way to find series of window functions with both good performances and easy calculation.   \n",

A number of helmet antenna designs will be analyzed and demonstrated in the bands of interest of 750-870 MHz, and 1350-2700 MHz. The helmet antenna solutions use conductive ink printing techniques to realize antenna elements that are conformal to the helmet's shape. The solutions are highly integrated into the helmet and other equipment on the soldier head for a helmet antenna system with negligible or no equipment weight gain. The design of the antenna system will take into account of the electromagnetic coupling of the head, torso and other soldier equipment on the performance of the antenna system. A Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) study will ensure safety or the user.   \n",

Such a coarse quantization of the prediction residual can produce audible quantizing noise in the reproduced speech signal at the receiver. This paper describes a new method of quantization for improving the speech quality. The improvement is obtained by center clipping the prediction residual and by fine quantization of the high-amplitude portions of the prediction residual. The threshold of center clipping is adjusted to provide encoding of the prediction residual at a specified bit rate. This method of quantization not only improves the speech quality by accurate quantization of the prediction residual when its amplitude is large but also allows encoding of the prediction residual at bit rates below 1 bit/sample.   \n",

We compared FAI echoes collocated with 630 nm airglow depletion detected by an all-sky imager. The thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures obtained by a Fabry-Perot interferometer at Kototabang and the altitudes of F-layer (h'F) observed with ionosondes at Kototabang, Chiang Mai, and Chumphon were also examined. We found that the 3-m scale post-midnight FAIs occurred within plasma bubbles. The convergence of the equatorward neutral winds happened in this particular event related to midnight temperature maximum (MTM) and that the equatorward winds in both northern and southern hemispheres could be responsible for the growth of plasma bubbles around midnight. The uplift of F-layer at low latitudes could increase the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Eastward electric currents driven by the equatorward winds could also contribute to the generation of the irregularities at post-midnight.   \n",

However, the average GAs are confronted with a few inevitable issues. These issues not only seriously influence the efficiency of GA operations, but also seriously limit the application range of GAs.

To avoid the consequences of trapping the main program thread, multithreaded CPUs can exploit control and data independence by executing the exception handler in a separate hardware context. The main thread doesn't squash instructions after the excepting instruction, conserving fetch bandwidth and allowing execution of instructions independent of the exception. This leads to earlier branch resolution in the post exception code and additional memory latency tolerance. As a proof of concept, using threads to handle software TLB misses is shown to provide performance approaching that of an aggressive hardware TLB miss handler.   \n",

In this work, a new method of cubic spline interpolation (CSI) is proposed and derived mathematically from the input samples respecting the time-domain boundary conditions, and the corresponding piecewise polynomials are optimized in the frequency domain to achieve good spectral properties. A comparative analysis of several prior arts, including arbitrary frequency response polynomial (AFRP) and basis spline (B-spline) is also presented, giving a clear overview of the advantages associated with the proposed technique in terms of implementation complexity, latency, and in-band and out-of-band spectral performance. The measurement results with three different radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) prototypes using an input stimulus comprised of different instantaneous bandwidth (iBW) carrier aggregated 5G new radio (NR) waveform are demonstrated to highlight the improved performance in the context of digital predistortion (DPD) correction. Finally, the architecture of the proposed method is illustrated, which is suitable for real-time high-speed digital implementation.   \n",

The successful selection and use of insulation, particularly insulation operated with maximum economy as in the case of static condensers, depends on our progress in the understanding of the factors on which insulation quality depends. The hysteresis loss is definitely related to the phenomenon of absorption or residual charge, especially when the residual voltage quickly builds up. In order to further analyze dielectric losses, and study the progress of treatment of insulation, a device has been developed for measuring dielectric absorption. This article describes the “Dielectric Lag Meter” and gives some test data secured by it.   \n",

The first estimator consists of a two-layer neural network (often called a perceptron) while in the second a three-layer neural network is used for motor speed estimation. Both estimators are simulated with an indirect field oriented controller (IFOC) for induction motor drives.   \n",

Since it belongs to the class of one-step-decodable majority codes, it can be decoded at an exceptionally high speed. This class of codes is derived from a set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares. This mutually orthogonal property provides a class of codes having a unique feature of “modularity.” The parity check matrix possesses a uniform pattern and results in a small number of inputs to modulo 2 adders. This class of codes has m\\n2\\n data bits, where m is an integer, and 2tm check bits for t-error correcting.   \n",

State-space techniques are employed to derive an equivalent nonlinear discrete time model that describes the converter exactly. The system is linearized about its equilibrium state to obtain a linear discrete time model for small signal performance evaluations, such as stability, audiosusceptibility, and transient response. The analysis makes extensive use of the digital computer as an analytical tool. It is universal, exact, and easy to use.   \n",

In this paper, we focus on human attractiveness in matchmaking for the new generation of individuals in China based on If You Are The One, a famous dating game show in China. We collect a comprehensive contestant dataset, including numeric, text and image attributes. We investigate the influence of various factors on human attractiveness using correlation analysis and average face technology. Experimental results show that attractiveness is closely related to job and age, and facial features are more important for female than for male. A visualization of the matching network is also given to further explore some interesting phenomena.   \n",

It can operate in both motoring and generating modes. In this paper, a prototype three phase flux reversal machine operating as a generator is studied both theoretically and experimentally. The equivalent model considering the core losses is obtained through extensive loss tests. A constant output voltage rectifier-chopper unit is then coupled with the loss model and the PSpice simulation is carried out. Hardware of the rectifier-chopper unit is then built and put into operation together with the FRM. Encouraging results are achieved indicating that the three phase FRM, with proper output control, is a viable option for the next generation automotive generator system with the merits of robustness, low cost, wide speed range and fast transient response. Whereas the studied machine in this paper is only a prototype, a new three phase FRM of improved design is being built and its projected performance in terms of the power density and the cogging torque is much better.   \n",

The goal of these efforts is to intervene using these controllable variables as early as possible and at key transition junctions for the most benefit to the students. Yet, there is still not a general agreement, let alone a consensus, neither on the most important factors nor on the degree of their contributions. While we cannot provide a panacea to this elusive and challenging problem, in this paper, we report our initial study, analyses, and results of what we intend to transform into a longitudinal undertaking to delineate success factors in computing programs in general, and in CS2 (data structures) courses in particular. Our analyses confirm some of the findings from the literature, such as CS1 performance as the most important contributor for CS2 success as well as prior programming experience, and perception of computing. At the same time we diverge from some of the literature on such factors as high school GPA or CSO performance. Our conclusions corroborate one of the rare consensus in the computing education literature that more efforts should still be exerted in this important topic. We also provide a new and novel taxonomy of the factors for success in computing programs as well as a short summary of the ACM Guidelines over time.   \n",

The research fills gap of quantum squeezing to drum resonator for implementing graphene-based nanoscale transducers with ultra-high sensitivity that can be potentially utilized to detect a variety of sensing targets, including atomic force, single biological molecule, and gravitational wave.   \n",

When the state of the world changes faster than our ability to discover these state changes and update the data repositories accordingly, the confidence on the validity of data decays with time, and software systems running in such environments have to cope with the decay of confidence in the data lest they run the risk of giving wrong answers and behaving erroneously. This gradual loss of confidence in stored data is termed information obsolescence, and it is inherently a temporal phenomenon. We have come across such a problem when designing an information system for traffic monitoring and control in a large city, and investigate some problems related to this modelling task. We propose two approaches to deal with information obsolescence, the analytical approach and the algebraic approach, and show how both can converge to a general, temporal treatment of obsolescence. Our immediate goal is to try to approximate and reduce the whole problem of monitoring and controlling obsolescence of information to a purely temporal phenomenon, so that we can model the system using conventional temporal database technology.   \n",

Filament generation and their lengths are controlled by current pulses through the element. A general in-package trim technique was developed using the trimistor and a high-voltage high-current diode, allowing the package pins to be multifunctional. This combination permits the input offset voltage for each channel of a quad op amp to be trimmed in the package to 10 /spl mu/V. The differential input stage utilizes JFET followers, which allows the separation of JFET/bipolar biasing currents. This results in a low offset voltage temperature coefficient (1/spl sigma/) of 2.5 /spl mu/V//spl deg/C. The gain-bandwidth product is enhanced over the unity-gain frequency by using a dual-doublet frequency-compensation technique. One doublet is defined using the JFET follower with feedforward capacitance, and the second doublet is formed by local positive AC feedback applied to the input current mirror. The amplifier is unity-gain stable, with a 100 MHz gain-bandwidth product (at 100 kHz) and 25 V//spl mu/S slew rate. The symmetrical quad layout is 80/spl times/120 mil/SUP 2/ with 6% of the area dedicated to trim. The die is suitable for a 14-pin narrow-body surface-mount package.   \n",

Stencil computation has a small operational intensity so that a large external memory bandwidth is usually required for high performance. FPGAs have the potential to solve this problem by utilizing large internal memory efficiently. However, a very large design, testing and debugging time is required to implement an FPGA architecture successfully. To solve this problem, we propose an FPGA-platform using C-like programming language called open computing language (OpenCL). We also propose an optimization methodology to find the optimal architecture for a given application using the proposed FPFA-platform. According to the experimental results, we achieved 119 - 237 Gflop/s of processing power and higher processing speed compared to conventional GPU and multicore CPU implementations.   \n",

If guarantee funds are to be effective, a majority of firms can obtain financial assistance through corporate bonds market. This paper describes the mutual guarantee bond which can be a viable solution to the problem of access to credit from capital market for small and middle-entrepreneurs. This work uses a jump diffusion process to estimate the price of mutual guarantee bonds made under the terms of the China Small Business Financing Program. First, a logistic structural model of mutual guarantee bond is built up. The model was then employed to design the logical pricing model of credit spread when an exogenous default process jumps for the first time. A geometrical attenuation function is introduced to reflect the unexpected default of intensities. Furthermore, the pricing model of collective small-medium corporate bonds as the spot interest rate is assumed to follow Vasicek model. Finally, the work tests the pricing model with one thousand times Monte Carlo methods and offer theoretical background and empirical evidence for further financial innovation as well.   \n",

The predistorter is modeled as an IIR Hammerstein system. The parameters of the linear and nonlinear blocks of the Hammerstein predistorter are estimated simultaneously using the Nonlinear Filtered-x Prediction Error Method (NFxPeM) algorithm. The NFxPEM algorithm has much higher convergence speed than the Nonlinear Filtered-x Least Mean Squares (NFxLMS) algorithm. In the NFxPEM algorithm, the nonlinear system is assumed to be known or accurately identified. In this paper, the NFxPEM with Initial Subsystem Estimates (NFxPEM-ISE) algorithm is developed to avoid accurate identification of the nonlinear system. Simulation study shows that the NFxPEM-ISE algorithm can efficiently precompensate the nonlinear distortion. Also, the NFxPEM-ISE algorithm achieves better performance as compared to the NFxLMS-ISE algorithm.   \n",

By looking at Apgar score, medics decide whether the newborn need any attention such as resuscitation or intubation. Determining the possibility of the need for immediate intervention and immediate medical response is vital for the baby. In this study, the UC signals received from the mother before birth, and physiological data gathered from mother and fetus were used for this determination. As the analysis method, Mann-Whitney U test was used. Data was separated into two classes called intervention and non-intervention. Statistical data and UC signal were used to compare classes. 26 attributes were extracted. However, for only 5 out of 26 attributes have been found to be significantly different between the classes.   \n",

However, many AI-enabled Internet-of-Things (AIoT) systems are vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. Therefore, designing robust deep learning models that can be deployed on resource-constrained devices has become an important research topic in the field of 6G-enabled AIoT. In this article, we propose a method for automatically searching for robust and efficient neural network structures for AIoT systems. By introducing a skip connection structure, a feature map with reduced front-end influence can be used for calculations during the classification process. Additionally, a novel type of densely connected search space is proposed. By relaxing this space, it is possible to search for network structures efficiently. In addition, combined with adversarial training and model delay constraints, we propose a multiobjective gradient optimization method to realize the automatic searching of network structures. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective for AIoT systems and superior to state-of-the-art neural architecture search algorithms.   \n",

Over the years, various deficiencies have been identified. In this paper, we focus on the implicit RTO offset problem, where the exact timeout limit of each packet is stretched by restarting the timer using the current timer value on the arrival of each acknowledgement (that acknowledges some new data). It would result in a slow timeout detection which unavoidably degrades the TCP throughput. In this paper, we first present a review of the TCP-RFC with special focus on the implicit RTO offset problem. Based on the insights obtained, we propose an enhanced RTO timer implementation, called E-RTO, for TCP. The implicit RTO offset is removed by mimicking the operation of a multi-timer implementation using a single timer. We then compare our E-RTO with TCP-RTO by simulations. We show that the faster timeout detection of our E-RTO leads to a throughput improvement of up to 3%.   \n",

It focuses on the ability of Education Sector to change and adapt quickly, to be responsive to new technologies and methodologies and be flexible to the needs of the students, parents and government. Video meetings, online teaching, digital platforms, etc. are the technologies used to increase the growth of online education. So, I have defined the different analysis study based on earlier education system and new education system. A drastic change is predicted in the education sector.   \n",

Currently, methods exist for tracking rolling leukocytes in vivo which rely on manual detection of the cells. In this paper, a new technique inspired by the teardrop shape of the rolling leukocytes is presented for accurately detecting rolling leukocytes. It is based on a feature score, the gradient inverse coefficient of variation (GICOV), which serves to discriminate rolling leukocytes from a cluttered environment. The leukocyte detection process consists of three sequential steps: The first step utilizes a novel teardrop shape matching algorithm to coarsely identify the leukocytes by finding the leukocytes resembling teardrops with a locally maximal GICOV. Second and third steps involve evolution of B-spline snake starting from each of the teardrops found in the first step to refine the leukocytes boundaries and associated GICOV score, and retaining contours with high GICOV scores. The detection process is observed to yield superior results compared to other methods currently in use. The deformation information inherent in the teardrop shapes gives valuable information about the extent to which the cells are adhering to the endothelium.   \n",

The cluster has a moderate temperature (kT= 4.1 ± 0.3 keV) and appears to be relaxed. Emission is detected at ≥3σ significance to a radius of 88 per cent of R\\n200\\n (the radius enclosing an overdensity of 200 times the critical density at z= 0.624) in a surface brightness profile. A temperature profile (extending to 0.7R\\n200\\n) and hardness ratio map show no significant departures from the global temperature, within the statistical limits of the data. The cluster bolometric X‐ray luminosity is L\\nX\\n= (4.3 ± 0.3) × 10\\n44\\n erg s\\n‐1\\n, and the total mass derived within R\\n200\\n, assuming isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium, is M\\n200\\n= 3.0\\n+0.6\\n−0.5\\n× 10\\n14\\n M\\n⊙\\n. The gas entropy measured at 0.1R\\n200\\n is compared with a sample of local systems, and found to be consistent with self‐similar evolution with redshift. The metallicity, gas density profile slope and gas mass fraction are all consistent with those found in low‐z clusters.   \n",

The system consists of a probe, equipped with sensors and with a water sampling device, and of a control unit, connected though an umbilical. With respect to other available systems of the same kind, the one at issue has innovative features, both in the mechatronic design and in the control and data processing architecture. In particular, thanks to modularity, the probe can be assembled in different configurations, according to the user's requirements and to the dimension of the inspection well. The system self-organizes itself according to the chosen configuration and, analyzing collected data, it can implement a number of auto-diagnosis procedures that improve reliability. In addition, using fuzzy reasoning, the system is able to provide a first rough evaluation of the quality of the monitored groundwater body, so to support and facilitate the operator's activity and decisional task. The system can be operated by means of two different man/machine interfaces, a simpler one for routine use and a more powerful one for greater interactivity, also from remote locations via Internet.   \n",

This study proposes and analyzes an integrated implementation of these two forensic guidelines. The result of this will provide a forensic investigator with a good understanding of the two forensic standards, and present an opportunity to forensic investigators, organizations and jurisdictions that are compliant in one standard to realize the benefits of the other standard. As it is shown, no single standard addresses all processes of digital forensic investigations. This comparison identifies areas of forensics guidelines covered by each standard, commonalities and differences in the two standards, and their limitations.   \n",

Manual identification becomes exceptionally challenging and time consuming because of the distinction in morphologies and size of lesions. Manual annotation of lesions by professionals is labor intensive and therefore requires the development of automatic segmentation techniques, but still it is also a challenging task because of the low local contrast and small size lesions present in the image. The automatic segmentation of retinal lesions through deep learning approach is of great impact for the initial diagnosis and treatment of DR. This paper proposes a patch based approach using encoder-decoder neural network to perform retinal lesions segmentation in fundus images. The architecture is trained and validated on IDRiD dataset which consists of microaneurysms, hemorrhages and hard exudate segmentations. In this approach for creating image patches a sliding widow technique is used, later the network evaluates the patches of the images and produces a probability map that predicts different types of lesions. An elaborative experiment was accompanied on IDRiD to calculate the performance of the suggested approach. The projected sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 97.24%, 99.97%, and 99.97% respectively, which validates the effectiveness and dominance of this technique. When compared with other studies on similar tasks, the results obtained by this work indicate substantially improved performance in terms of sensitivity & specificity.   \n",

Data for research were received by experimental path for the accelerator two different models which is used for double purpose. The solenoid inductance was determined on the basis calculation of the magnetic vector potential succeeded by calculation of magnetic field energy. Optimum value of inductance for two models when value of kinetic energy reaches the maximum level was determined, it influences on escape speed of plasma jet. Analysis of the solenoid inductance was made, it influences on increasing transverse velocity component, and thus, the metal erosion and amount of disperse powders. The system of second order differential equations was written down as first order differential equations for calculation accuracy increasing and was solved using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta fixed-step method. View of potential pit was simulated in software package COMSOL Multiphysics which shows spatial limitation of the plasma particles expansion and illustrates the advantages of the longitudinal and transverse components of the charged particles velocity in the plasma jet. Simulation data allow to improve technological parameters of the investigated accelerator. The test of a model for adequacy was completed by calculation energy balance for system.   \n",

The angular two‐point correlation function is calculated for 11 samples with flux limits of S\\n3.6\\n≥ 4–400 μJy, over an 8 deg\\n2\\n field. The angular clustering strength is measured at >5σ significance at all flux limits, with amplitudes of A= (0.49–29) × 10\\n−3\\n at 1°, for a power‐law model, Aθ\\n−0.8\\n. We estimate the redshift distributions of the samples using phenomological models, simulations and photometric redshifts, and so derive the spatial correlation lengths. We compare our results with the Galaxies In Cosmological Simulations (GalICS) models of galaxy evolution and with parametrized models of clustering evolution. The GalICS simulations are consistent with our angular correlation functions, but fail to match the spatial clustering inferred from the phenomological models or the photometric redshifts. We find that the uncertainties in the redshift distributions of our samples dominate the statistical errors in our estimates of the spatial clustering. At low redshifts (median z≤ 0.5), the comoving correlation length is approximately constant, r\\n0\\n= 6.1 ± 0.5 h\\n−1\\n Mpc, and then decreases with increasing redshift to a value of 2.9 ± 0.3 h\\n−1\\n Mpc for the faintest sample, for which the median redshift is z∼ 1. We suggest that this trend can be attributed to a decrease in the average galaxy and halo mass in the fainter flux‐limited samples, corresponding to changes in the relative numbers of early‐ and late‐type galaxies. However, we cannot rule out strong evolution of the correlation length over 0.5 < z < 1.   \n",

In emotional speech recognition system prosodic and spectral features provide a significant detecting parameter in differentiating various classes of emotions as these features closely resembles human vocal tract system. The statistical properties of these features vary with different emotional speech utterances and due to change in ascent, speaking style and language of the speaker.

The method presented proves to be effective for the use of the same system in both learning and evaluation phases. This homogeneity represents a great advance in the feedback processes between students and teachers as it provides information on the progress made in real time. The information acquired during the learning phase can also be used to monitor correct development of the subjects throughout the teaching periods or to detect deficiencies in specific students. The results of the proposed method are justified by a study of 170 students over two academic years.   \n",

However, enabling D2D communications in a cellular network causes interference because of spectrum sharing. In this paper, to mitigate the interference and make full use of the advantage of D2D communications, we propose a joint spectrum resource allocation and power control (RAPC) scheme to maximize the total throughput while guaranteeing the minimum required rate for both D2D users and cellular users. We formulate the optimization problem of resource allocation and power control and we obtain the near-optimal solution by quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) method, in which the quantum particles represent the solutions of resource allocation and power control. A penalty function is formulated to delete the infeasible solutions. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has a better performance on system throughput, power efficiency and minimum rate satisfactory than other schemes.   \n",

However, KBs of life science in Chinese are necessary when we want to automatically process and analyze electronic medical records (EMRs) in Chinese. Of all, the symptom KB in Chinese is the most seriously in need, since symptoms are the starting point of clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, expressions used in describing symptoms in clinical practice are diverse, which makes it hard to collect such a KB. In this paper, we publish a public KB of symptoms in Chinese. The KB is constructed by fusing data automatically extracted from eight mainstream healthcare websites, three Chinese encyclopedia sites, and symptoms extracted from a large number of EMRs as supplements. As a result, the KB has more than 26,000 distinct symptoms in Chinese including 3,968 symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and 1,029 synonym pairs for symptoms. The KB also includes concepts such as diseases and medicines as well as relations between symptoms and the above related entities. We also link our KB to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and analyze the differences between symptoms in the two KBs. We released the KB as Linked Open Data and a demo at https://datahub.io/dataset/symptoms-in-chinese.   \n",

Several different techniques, i.e., simple rule-based to lexicon-based and more sophisticated machine learning algorithms, have been widely used with different classifiers to get the factual analysis of sentiment. However, lexicon-based sentiment classification is still suffering from low accuracies, mainly due to the deficiency of domain-oriented competitive dictionaries. Similarly, machine learning-based sentiment is also tackling the accuracy constraints because of feature ambiguity from social data. One of the best ways to deal with the accuracy issue is to select the best feature-set and reduce the volume of the feature. This paper proposes a method (namely, GAWA) for feature selection by utilizing the Wrapper Approaches (WA) to select the premier features and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reduce the size of the premier features. The novelty of this work is the modified fitness function of heuristic GA to compute the optimal features by reducing the redundancy for better accuracy. This work aims to present a comprehensive model of hybrid sentiment by using the proposed method, GAWA. It will be valued in developing a new approach for the selection of feature-set with a better accuracy level. The experiments revealed that these techniques could reduce the feature-set up-to 61.95% without negotiating the accuracy level. The new optimal feature sets enhanced the efficiency of the Naïve Bayes algorithm up to 92%. This work is compared with the conventional method of feature selection and concluded the 11% better accuracy than PCA and 8% better than PSO. Furthermore, the results are compared with the literature work and found that the proposed method outperformed the previous research.   \n",

These can increase productivity and offer an improved lifestyle for users. The data management system-context architecture (DMS-CA) has been designed to provide these services. The DMS-CA is novel in providing a completely generic system that is both user-friendly and efficient. The system is generic in that it can be tailored by the system administrator (using XML specifications) for a particular environment of context information inputs and a set of services. In addition, the actual rules that determine which services are triggered by which combination of contextual inputs are determined by the individual user in a user-friendly manner. Thus the generic architecture can be easily deployed for a particular building and an individual user. Generic solutions are sometimes inefficient but this system has been designed to be highly efficient through using an event-based architecture and dealing with time in a special way. The DMS-CA has been deployed for a building incorporating a wireless sensor network, and shown to provide a high quality, efficient context-sensitive data delivery service.   \n",

Using quotient space granular computing theory, the problem can be macro-level analysis - examining different particle size between the quotient space conversion, movement, interdependent relations, and the original features of the database information to build grain size, using a variety of granularity, from different levels of analysis of complex gas data makes the learning characteristics of the sample is more obvious, in order to better meet the requirements of machine learning. Constructive neural network learning method achieves the data mining of different particle size structure the quotient space from the micro. At last, the method is applied to predict gas concentration, and the satisfying results are achieved. It is expected that Constructive Neural Network Learning Method will have wide applications.   \n",

A 64-element circumferential array was placed inside a compliant silicone balloon catheter to capture real-time, phase-sensitive radio frequency (RF) data during deformation experiments. Strains over 40% could be applied to normal arterial wall tissue with intracatheter pressures as low as 200 kPa (2 atm). Strain images of a hard-soft rubber phantom, thrombus, and fibrotic plaque were produced using the integrated balloon ultrasound catheter. Results show that this catheter can apply large deformations at low pressures and image various vascular pathologies ex vivo. Potentially, it can serve as a multifunctional, intravascular therapeutic device to guide angioplasty and stent deployment.   \n",

However, the instruction conflicts across blocks also need to be taken into account while compiling. In order to solve this problem with as less performance loss as possible, the paper presents a general framework which hides the delay of conflicts in three different aspects. The experiments indicate that the proposed algorithms have achieved the goal of solving the conflicts with less cost in performance.   \n",

It has been known that the secrecy capacity of such a channel does not increase with signal-to-noise ratio when the transmitter has no channel state information (CSI) under mild conditions. Motivated by Jafar's robust interference alignment technique, we study the so-called staggered multi-antenna block-fading wiretap channel where the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper have different temporal correlation structures. Assuming no CSI at transmitter, we characterize lower and upper bounds on the secrecy degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) of the channel at hand. Our results show that a positive s.d.o.f. can be ensured whenever two receivers experience different fading variation. Remarkably, very simple linear precoding schemes provide the optimal s.d.o.f. in some cases of interest.   \n",

The applied convergence-acceleration technique guaranties minimal computational effort. Due to the inherently stable circuit topology time-domain simulations can be conducted trouble-free with arbitrary active/passive non-linear loads. For a given frequency bandwidth the required model order can be estimated a priori. The presented model is validated in the frequency and time domain.   \n",

To get conducting angles of switches, the conventional method needs simultaneous equations corresponding to the fundamental and harmonic components by the use of Fourier series. Since they are calculated by an iterative method, the process is accompanied with a large amount of calculation and much time. Moreover, they are calculated by means of off-line operation. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a simple method to obtain the conducting angles. They are calculated by using voltage-second areas of the divided reference voltage according to the output voltage levels.

For the sake of concreteness, we consider an analog processing stage composed of a switching network with analog combining. The main contribution of this work consists on the proposal and evaluation of an optimization procedure based on a smart relaxation. The optimal hybrid precoder under a transmit power constraint is derived, after which, the analog precoding matrix is binarized. After an intuitive reasoning, we note that multiple solutions exist. Nevertheless, the (very) reduced computational complexity of the proposed optimization scheme makes it feasible for realistic implementations. Numerical results are reported to assess the performance of proposed hybrid precoder design.   \n",

Most of the optimizations are based on algorithms and methodologies, which have been developed by the author in-house. This is because traditional techniques cannot handle difficulties due to the large number of components, the requirement of high accuracy, the limitation of tolerance or the need for computer time. New IPs and patents have also been developed during the optimization.   \n",

The theory is both simple and intuitive, it is compared with experiments on a parametric amplifier, and a very good agreement is found. Furthermore, using theoretical results, a method to obtain saturation characteristics for parametric amplifiers that have features not easily reproduced by theory is presented. The obtained method finds saturation characteristics in a few steps, providing that the gain studied is above 15 dB, where the approximations upon which our simple expression is based are strictly valid. An exact solution of the gain saturation when the pump power is totally converted is also presented and compared with the simplified expression using previously obtained theoretical results   \n",

Predictions based on dispersion theory for frequencies above 10 Hz fall below experimental data and do not account for wind-speed dependence. The discrepancy may rest either in the linear wave-model or the mechanism. Laboratory measurements of wind waves show low spatial coherence and no evidence of dispersion at high frequencies, suggesting that the surface dynamics are more like convective turbulence than linear waves. While spectral estimates based on this model do not yet account for field data, the effects of nonlinear phenomena noted in the experiments remain to be examined.<\\n>   \n",

It is one of the dissemination channels for the Integrated Public Alert and Warnings System (IPAWS). WEA typically broadcasts an alert in the cells with at least some portion affected by the emergency event. When the affected area includes only portions of one or more cells, there could be a high proportion of False Positives (people who should not have been notified get the message on their cell phones) and/or False Negatives (people who should have been notified but are not notified). We propose a scheme that uses the mobile devices' knowledge of their own location and the target area described in the cell broadcast message to filter the messages in the cell phone and notify the user only when the mobile device's estimated location is within the target area. We evaluate the new scheme in terms of false negatives and positives, radio resource requirements, and notification latency, and compare it with various other geotargeting schemes. We also discuss mechanisms to communicate the target area information efficiently in the limited bandwidth available in cellular broadcast channel. Finally, we discuss ways for allowing a broader set of contexts to determine whether a user should be notified of a given emergency.   \n",

Linear correspondence measures like correlation and the sum of squared differences are known to be fragile. Ordinal measures, which are based on relative ordering of intensity values in windows, have demonstrable robustness to depth discontinuities, occlusion and noise. The relative ordering of intensity values in each window is represented by a rank permutation which is obtained by sorting the corresponding intensity data. By using a novel distance metric between the rank permutations, we arrive at ordinal correlation coefficients. These coefficients are independent of absolute intensity scale, i.e. they are normalized measures. Further, since rank permutations are invariant to monotone transformations of the intensity values, the coefficients are unaffected by nonlinear effects like gamma variation between images. We have developed a simple algorithm for their efficient implementation. Experiments suggest the superiority of ordinal measures over existing techniques under non-ideal conditions. Though we present ordinal measures in the context of stereo, they serve as a general tool for image matching that is applicable to other vision problems such as motion estimation and image registration.   \n",

Therefore, recurrent monitoring of arterial condition is essential. The photoplethysmogram (PPG) technique is a simple and cost effective technique in measuring blood volume change. Second derivative of photoplethysmogram (SDPPG) which is one of the applications of PPG was used for monitoring the arterial condition. Informal method SDPPG which substitutes the formal SDPPG aging index (SDPPG-AI) has been selected as an appropriate method to be applied. Test on twenty-three diabetic patients showed higher index of vascular aging compared to healthy subject.   \n",

In this paper, two novel PM tubular machines named partitioned stator interior PM (PS-IPM) and partitioned stator surface-mounted PM (PS-SPM) tubular machines are proposed. Both the proposed machines are optimized for maximum thrust force, and their electromagnetic performance has been compared. It is found that the PS-IPM tubular machine has higher thrust force capability and better magnet utilization compared with the PS-SPM tubular machine. However, due to lower cogging force, the PS-SPM tubular machine has fewer thrust force ripples. Furthermore, the effect of the cross-coupling magnetic saturation on PM flux linkage, and the d-axis and q-axis inductances for both the proposed machines is investigated. It is demonstrated that the PM flux linkage and the d-axis and q-axis inductances are affected by the cross-coupling magnetic saturation. Moreover, the force-velocity characteristics of the proposed machines are calculated and compared. It is observed that both the machines have good constant power operation capability.   \n",

In this paper, a novel matrix model for passband OFDM-OQAM signaling with a small number of subcarriers over a multipath frequency selective fading channel is presented. Specifically, in OFDM-OQAM a frequency selective channel is divided into many smaller but still frequency selective overlapping channels, so approximating the frequency response of a subchannel by the channel frequency response sampled at the subcarrier frequency may be inadequate. Channel effects may be better characterized if the frequency response of each subchannel is represented as a Taylor expansion at the subcarrier frequency. Simulation results show how the matrix model implemented by means of this approximation is a suitable model for OFDM-OQAM with a small number of subcarriers.   \n",

But it is almost impossible to determine the actual demand of electricity in Bangladesh due to shortage of organized data. In this research, a statistical method has been presented to estimate the total demand of Bangladesh in a typical peak hour in 2011. This procedure is acceptable for a power system like that in Bangladesh where bona fide particulars is absent.   \n",

Probabilistic load models for both the domestic and electric vehicle loads are developed to give insight into the stochastic nature of load distribution and voltage bands. The results not only provide the maximum voltage deviations, but their probability of occurrence during a given period of time. With this information, a recommendation for future grid planning can be developed, which takes into account the increasing load caused by electric mobility. Furthermore, a load management system is proposed to reduce maximum load thus avoiding costs for increasing feeder capacities.   \n",

However, in the cluttered environment, it may generate a large number of clutters. In this paper, we propose the target detection algorithm which applies the maximum local contrast as the target selection method. Our proposed algorithm can considerably improve the detection rate more than the method using the maximum energy value.   \n",

This study evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of this new architecture exploring several dimensions in the space of Transactional Memory (TM) application characteristics using the Eigenbench [1] and the CLOMP-TM [2] benchmarks. This detailed performance study provides insights on the constraints imposed by the Intel's Transaction Synchronization Extension (Intel's TSX) and introduces a simple, but efficient policy for guaranteeing forward progress on top of the besteffort Intel's HTM and also was critical to achieving performance. The evaluation also shows that there are a number of potential improvements for designers of TM applications and software systems that use Intel's TM and provides recommendations to extract maximum benefit from the current TM support available in Haswell.   \n",

To improve switching performance, energy/switching, and also the robustness of the subthreshold logic for the implementation of 1-bit static full adder, we propose the use of sub-FinFET (sub-threshold voltage FinFET) transistors. The power, speed and energy evaluation has been carried out using extensive simulation on HSPICE circuit simulator. The simulation results are based on 32 nm CMOS Berkeley Predictive Technology Model (BPTM).   \n",

However, crop spectral mixture is still the major that limits the performance of paddy rice identification when using the spectral information alone. In order to eliminate the influence of spectral mixture on crop mapping accuracy, an innovative method was proposed to produce field-level canopy height data by calculating the elevation difference between the vegetated and nonvegetated parcels. We applied support vector machine on four types of datasets: 1) Pixel-based Spectral Features (PSF); 2) PSF and Canopy Height Features; 3) Object-based Spectral Features (OSF); and 4) Object-based Spectral Features and Canopy Height Features (OSCHF). The results showed that the full-class classification accuracy from OSCHF was the highest with an overall accuracy of 94.04% and Kappa of 0.91, which was significantly higher than result using OSF, and the accuracy of PSF was the worst. The OSF could eliminate speckle noise problem to some extent, but grapes and trees were still to some extent misclassified as paddy rice due to similar spectrum. Fortunately, these confusions were effectively avoided by including the canopy height.   \n",

The DD2 filter linearizes the nonlinear dynamic and measurement functions by using a second-order interpolation formula to approximate the derivatives of nonlinear functions. We compare the new method, extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The simulation results show that DD2 filter outperform EKF and UKF in terms of estimation accuracy and filtering credibility. We conclude that the DD2 filter is a strong candidate for the ballistic target tracking problem being studied.   \n",

This scheduling method is applied to a flexible manufacturing system. A reschedule strategy is utilized to solve dynamic disturbances happened during manufacturing process. Experimental results show that schedule can be repaired efficiently and correctly without obviously affecting the scheduling performance.   \n",

Most current systems fail to consider business objectives and thus to provide a complete SLA management solution. This work proposes an SLA-driven management solution that aims to maximize the provider's profit by reducing resource costs as well as fines owning to SLA violations. Specifically, this work proposes a framework that comprises multiple, configurable control loops and supports automatically adjusting service configurations and resource usage in order to maintain SLAs in the most cost-effective way.

The impact of the students receiving education online for the entire semester on their final grade was analysed and the results are shown in the paper. These results are obtained by analysing the academic course Mathematical Analysis 2, held online at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Croatia, in the summer semester of 2020. Furthermore, the number of views of the lectures in relation to the time left until the final exam was checked in order to investigate the students' studying habits. Unsurprisingly, the most noticeable effect here is the last minute cramming. Nevertheless, the overall results show the pros and cons of online education, as well as the huge potential that online education has, even when performed at the current state.   \n",

This so called 1+N protection scheme provides instantaneous recovery from single link failures. The performance of this scheme has thus far been considered for a network with unit traffic demands, and the reported results were based on simulations. In this paper, we give an analytical upper bound on the required transport capacity for 1+N protection in full-meshed networks with unit traffic demands. Next, we consider networks with uniform and exponentially distributed traffic demands, and derive more realistic bounds for the achievable network performance of 1+N protection in full-meshed networks.We will show analytically that the gains decrease significantly relative to a unit-traffic demand distribution, independent of the protection mechanism used.   \n",

This method combines region growing surface reconstruction with a topology structure slicing method for AMF model. We perform half-edge match in the region growing reconstruction process to obtain the topology structure of the triangular mesh model. Then, the topology relation between adjacent facets is preserved in an AMF file which is extensible, and a slicing process based on these topology information is accomplished. Our method integrates the slicing process of 3D printing with topology structure reconstruction, reducing the deviation brought by step-by-step operations. Compared with the slicing approaches based on STL files, experiments show that our method improves the slicing efficiency without decreasing the accuracy.   \n",

Aiming at the system characteristics of HST, a set of integer-order control methods based on the excellent approximation ability of Radial Basis Function Neural Network(RBFNN) are established firstly, and motivated by them, a kind of RBFNN-based fractional-order control methods are proposed by utilizing the genetic attenuation properties of fractional calculus(FC) in order to improve the control performance in the work. It should be pointed out that all the developed methods are able to deal with uncertainties and nonlinearities as well as actuator failures without the need for any “trail and error” process. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control methods are verified by Lyapunov theoretical analysis and numerical simulation studies. Besides, the control performance of integer-order control system and fractional-order control system is compared and analyzed, and the results show that the fractional-order control system is superior.   \n",

This topology can be applied in line voltage regulator, power factor correction (PFC) and uninterrupted power supplies (UPS). It is composed of three single-phase three-leg converters with a leg shared by both load and grid sides. Suitable modelling, a pulse-width modulation (PWM) strategy based on vector approach and a control system are developed. The proposed PWM and control strategies are suitable to balance the DC-link voltages and to optimize of the harmonic distortion, reducing switching stress and power losses. Simulation results are used to compare the studied configuration with a conventional solution in terms of harmonic distortion and semiconductor losses. Experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical considerations and were obtained by using IGBTs with dedicated drives and a digital signal processor (DSP) with appropriated plug-in boards and sensors.   \n",

Assuming that each sensor captures a different observation of the same object, the problem is to classify this object by distributed processing in the network. We present a graph-based problem formulation whose objective function captures the smoothness of candidate labels on the data manifold formed by the observations of the object. We design a distributed average consensus algorithm for estimating the unknown object class by computing the value of the smoothness objective function for different class hypotheses. It initially estimates the objective function locally based on the observation of each sensor. As the distributed consensus algorithm progresses, all observations are gradually taken into account in the estimation of the objective function. We illustrate the performance of the distributed classification algorithm for multiview face recognition in an ad hoc network of vision sensors. When the training set is sufficiently large, the simulation results show that the consensus classification decision is equivalent to the decision of a centralized system that has access to all observations.   \n",

The representation mechanism is judgements-as-types, developed for linear and other relevant logics. The λλ\\nκ\\n-calculus is a conservative extension of the λΠ-calculus and RLF is a conservative extension of LF.   \n",

We combine the Compressive Sensing (CS) and Deep Learning (DL) into a single framework for fusing data from multiple sensors to improve spatial and temporal resolution for long term analysis. CS is used as an initial guess to combine data from multiple sources. DL models, using Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM/RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), refine and further improve the data fusion from CS algorithm's output. The proposed framework has been tested the using daily global observations from two satellites the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and the JAXA Greenhouse gases from Orbiting Satellites (GOSAT). Our framework achieves lower errors and high correlation compared with the original data. The quality of fused data is evaluated by comparing again AmeriFlux ground station's datasets. Long term trends using fused data over the United States indicate an increase of 8 parts per million (ppm) annually in XCO2 over four years with Root Mean Square Errors of 0.39 ppm and correlation of 0.98 compared with original data. Interannual variability of the seasonal cycle shows an increase in years 2015 - 2017, but a sharp decrease in 2018.   \n",

This new generation of video games has this special name because it combines exercise (with the prefix “exer”) and games. Also, exergames can be used as a resource to support the development of motor skills, promotion of an active living and healthy lifestyle, sports skills learning or simply as a tool to increase caloric expenditure. Indeed, the entertainment features presented as in any other digital game can hold a very important role to make the users more active during their leisure activities, instead of sedentary lifestyle, commonly perceived in the modern society. Within this innovation perspective for video games, this study aims to present the evolution of different interfaces, prototypes and patterns where exergames were designed with the focus on an Active Living development against the typical sedentary style of the former video games in the past. Through the conception of promotion of Exercise in this type of digital games, this paper will also show as results, how conceptions were invented since the decade of 1980 until the current era of exergames.   \n",

Driver speed control is a complex behavior of longitudinal vehicle control consisting of speed perception, decision making, motor control, vehicle dynamics modeling, and individual driver differences. However, there are few existing models that can integrate all of these aspects in a cohesive manner. To address this problem, this paper introduces a mathematical model for a driver's speed control with analytical solutions based on human cognitive mechanisms in driving. This model includes an integrated queuing network-model human processor structure and the rule-based decision field theory. This new model consequently can predict several aspects of driver speed control behavior at the same time, such as driving speed, throttle/brake pedal angle, acceleration, and the frequency of speedometer inspection. A laboratory session involving a driving simulator is conducted to validate the current model. The model accounted for over 99% of the experimental speed of the average driver, and over 95% of the experimental speed for the majority of individual drivers.   \n",

By representing a polyphase network in phase-coordinates, i.e. phase voltages, currents and impedances, the unbalanced fault currents can also be analyzed and calculated. The proposed approach is direct and can be implemented easily by solving a set of linear system equations. Identical results for both methods are obtained in a sample network. The following faults are analyzed: phase-to-earth with/without impedance; phase-to-phase fault with/without impedance; two-phase-to-earth fault; and a three-phase fault.   \n",

This research aims to perceive the effect of coping strategies on the psychological being of Jabodetabek (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi) citizens during the Large- Scale Social Limitations period. Results showed that there was a significant relationship between coping strategies and psychological well-being (p=0.000<; 0.005). Research also found that most respondents cope by employing the emotion-focused coping system. It was strongly suspected that citizens were able to cope and manage stressors during the pandemic by doing self-improvement activities and trying to connect with their social network (friendship or work-related) with existing technological platforms. On the other hand, it was also suspected that the high number of respondents with emotion-focused coping was a result of feelings of helplessness in controlling problems arising during the pandemic, such as local government policies and socioeconomic impacts.   \n",

       "129  Axisymmetric models of the Milky Way exhibit strong interrelations between the Galactic constants [the Sun's distance to the Galactic Centre (R\\n0\\n), and the local rotation speed (θ\\n0\\n)], the local stellar column density [Σ∗(R\\n0\\n)] and the shortest-to-longest axis ratio of the dark matter halo (q). In this paper we present simple analytical approximations that allow for an efficient search through the vastness of parameter space, and apply this approximation to investigate the consequences of the uncertain gaseous velocity dispersion (σ\\ng\\n) on the constraints imposed by the thickness of the Milky Way's gas layer. The extra degree of freedom does not significantly alter the conclusions drawn in a previous paper on the shape of the Milky Way's dark matter halo. A significant contribution to the total gas pressure by cosmic rays and magnetic fields beyond the optical disc is thus ruled out. We find that the Milky Way's dark halo is close to spherical if R\\n0\\n≳7.1 kpc, while a significantly flattened dark matter halo is possible only if our distance to the Galactic Centre is smaller than ∼6.8 kpc.Thus, if R\\n0\\n is larger than ∼7 kpc, or θ\\n0\\n≳170 km s\\n−1\\n, we can rule out two dark matter candidates that require a highly flattened dark matter halo: (1) decaying massive neutrinos, and (2) a disc of cold molecular hydrogen.It is possible to construct a self-consistent axisymmetric model of the Galaxy based on the IAU-recommended values for the Galactic constants (R\\n0\\n=8.5 kpc, θ\\n0\\n=220 km s\\n−1\\n) only in the unlikely case that the effective gaseous velocity dispersion is ∼19 per cent larger than observed, and if the local stellar column density is less than about 18 M\\n⊙\\n pc\\n−2\\n. If we assume that the halo is oblate and a value of Σ∗ of 35±5 M\\n⊙\\n pc\\n−2\\n, we can rule out Galactic models with R\\n0\\n≳8.0 kpc and θ\\n0\\n≳200 km s\\n−1\\n.Combining the best kinematical and star-count estimates of Σ∗, we conclude that Σ∗ probably lies between 25 and 45 M\\n⊙\\n pc\\n−2\\n.

Limited energy of the sensor nodes is the main constraint in operation of the network. Several energy efficient routing protocols have been proposed to deal with this problem. In this paper we propose a leader selection algorithm for these routing protocols to enhance the network lifetime to a greater extent. Distance of the node from base station, degree of connectivity of the node and trust level of the node is individually analyzed and is linearly combined with weights associated with each parameter. This gives the overall potential function of a node to become a leader. The number of rounds after which leader selection takes place is also equated. Through simulation the algorithm is compared with traditional energy-distance based method for routing protocols LBEERA, OREC, PEGASIS and SHORT. Significant improvement of network lifetime is obtained using this leader selection algorithm. Highest improvement of more than 8% increase in network lifetime is observed when distance of the node from the base station is given a higher linear combination weight.   \n",

The safety model is used to calculate the probability and rate of an event leading to the hazard state - situation, where safety of a modeled system is violated, so the system may cause material loss or mortality. The reduction method allows us to prove that the rate of the event is sufficiently small hence the hazard state may be neglected. The real safety model of railway station signaling and interlocking equipments is used as a case study.   \n",

Specifically, ABS strategy places more emphasis on such training examples, including positive item with a lower preference score and negative items with a higher preference score for each gradient step. Then, we provide the corresponding proofs for the ABS strategy from both gradient and ranking perspectives. First, we prove that sampled training examples by ABS strategy can update the model parameters with a large magnitude and analyze two instantiations by combining two specific pairwise algorithms. Second, it can be proved that ABS strategy is equivalent to optimizing for ranking-aware evaluation metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Furthermore, ABS strategy can be very general and applicable in a lot of pairwise structures of pairwise algorithms. Based on ABS strategy, we provide an effective sampling algorithm to dynamically draw items for each SGD update. Finally, we evaluate the ABS strategy by conducting sampling tasks in two representative pairwise algorithms. The experiment results show that the ABS strategy performs significantly better than the baseline strategies.   \n",

Adiabatic reversible logic was examined in the 1980s and 1990s but in that era power dissipation was a secondary concern, and the trade-off of reduced computational speed for reduced power was deemed unacceptable. Now, power dissipation and the associated heat are the major obstacles limiting progress in integrated circuits, particularly processors. In modern processors trading performance for reduced power dissipation is already done using techniques such as multi-core and dark silicon, so adiabatic logic may now be an attractive approach. To evaluate the adiabatic approach, this paper uses the figure of merit of the product of switching energy, delay time, and area (EDA). Using this figure of merit, adiabatic logic is shown to be advantageous when additional constraints are considered, such as maximum allowed power density. As a proof of concept circuit, a simplified MIPS microprocessor was designed using adiabatic logic based on split-rail charge recovery logic and Bennett clocking. New design and verification tools were developed using structural Verilog and extensions of ModelSim to provide needed capabilities are not available in commercial packages. The design is implemented using a standard cell design.   \n",

A warm-up period is required where the new road segments must be populated with simulated vehicles. Techniques that convert vehicle flow rate and queue length information to vehicle positions and speeds are proposed to minimize this warm-up period. These techniques are evaluated and compared with respect to estimated travel times of vehicles traveling through different paths in the road network under different traffic conditions. Travel time predictions are compared to a microscopic simulation of the entire region.   \n",

In particular, we introduce an original MPC formulation that effectively takes into account the performance tradeoff between the clutch slip regulation and the torsional oscillation attenuation. Within this formulation, saturation constraints on the clutch torque input as well as the positiveness of the slipping speed needed to avoid gear engagement during the slip are effectively handled. A linear model of the actuator-driveline system is employed to cast the underlying MPC optimization problem as a quadratic programme that, thanks to the effective actually available solvers, allows a fast online implementation of the controller on real transmission control unit platforms. Extensive simulation results and preliminary experimental vehicle tests are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.   \n",

To do so, we applied a conventional method to generate pseduo-haptics. To control the amount of scroll resulting from finger displacement on a display, illusory resistance or pseudo friction was confirmed by subjective evaluation. We first clarified that this illusory resistance influences finger walking behavior such as stride or speed. An additional experiment conducted in public space verified this influence.   \n",

We proposed a method, which displays those pictures on one virtual large wall. For this presentation, the search key in our system is the location and the size of this large screen and from which direction to look.

The input H.264/AVC stream is fully decoded by the transcoder. Macroblock coding modes are extracted from the input stream and are reused to encode the output stream. A set of new motion vectors is computed from the input stream coded motion vectors, and are mapped to either the hierarchical B-frame or zero-delay referencing structures employed by H.264/SVC. These new motion vectors are further subjected to a 3 pixel refinement. As a result, a significant decrease in computational complexity is achieved, while maintaining a close to optimum compression efficiency.   \n",

Conductive channels can be prepared using conventional printing technologies and conductive inks. These preparation methods would cost less, and they are convenient for prototyping of microdevices. The use of hydrophilic organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (NPs), dispersed in water, enables the simplification of the electrode preparation process at room temperature. In this study, we developed a transparent breadboard and NP microelectrodes in the microfluidic channel to measure the number of particles. The electrode fabrication in the microfluidic channel can be acquired using conventional laboratory equipment without the need for expensive ultra-vacuum deposition instruments. We integrated the equipment with electrical measurement systems to count cells and/or microparticles. By using a parallel electric-circuit model (diluted case) or Langmuir isotherm model (saturated case), the particle concentration between two NP electrodes can be analyzed by measuring the capacitance of the total circuit. The microfluidic fabrication of electrodes and electrical measurement technologies may be potentially applied to the technology for micro-nano fluidics and bio-applications such as cell counting or ion sensing.   \n",

If high intensity protons were injected to RHIC by mistake, administrative radiation limits could be exceeded or sensitive electronics could be damaged. In the past, the changeover from polarized proton to high intensity proton operation has been a lengthy process, thereby never allowing the two programs to run simultaneously. To remedy this situation and allow concurrent operation of RHIC and BLIP, an active interlock system has been designed to monitor current levels in the AGS using two current transformers with fail safe circuitry and associated electronics to inhibit beam to RHIC if high intensity currents are detected.   \n",

While prior work indicates that mMIMO networks employing time division duplexing have a significant capacity growth potential, deploying mMIMO in frequency division duplexing (FDD) networks remains problematic. The two main difficulties in FDD networks are the scalability of the downlink reference signals and the overhead associated with the required uplink feedback for channel state information (CSI) acquisition. To address these difficulties, most existing methods utilize assumptions on the radio environment such as channel sparsity or angular reciprocity. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative method for a scalable and low-overhead approach to FDD mMIMO under the so-called grid-of-beams architecture. The key idea behind our scheme lies in the exploitation of the near-common signal propagation paths that are often found across several mobile users located in nearby regions, through a coordination mechanism. In doing so, we leverage the recently specified device-to-device communications capability in 5G networks. Specifically, we design beam selection algorithms capable of striking a balance between CSI acquisition overhead and multi-user interference mitigation. The selection exploits statistical information, through so-called covariance shaping. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which prove particularly well-suited to rapidly-varying channels with short coherence time.   \n",

Assuming a time division duplex that may offer channel reciprocity between down- and up-links, a low-complexity channel pre-equalization avoids explicit channel estimation at the BS with a very good performance for low MT velocities. A data-aided adaptive detection at the BS starting directly in a tracking mode thanks to pre-equalization can compensate for the increasing mismatch between channel pre-equalization and actual channel response caused by large velocities all along the uplink frame. Simulation results using a 4G realistic scenario show that the proposed uplink OFCDM system offers a good performance with a high spectral efficiency, as it is able to transmit large data rates with mobility and no need of pilot symbols.   \n",

The characteristics are intermediate between the Butterworth and Papoulis filters (with these two classes as limiting), and can be obtained starting from the filters of fifth order. The number of the intermediate characteristics increases with the filter order. Decreasing the pass-band flatness degree one can obtain additional attenuation in the stop-band.   \n",

A proposed socio-ecological energy system (SEES) framework used to characterize the core-level subsystems (resources, users, and governance) in terms of second-level and deeper level variables is motivated by the more general multilevel nested socio-ecological system (SES) framework. Second-level and deeper level variables are introduced as a means of characterizing how sustainable a SEES is likely to be by assessing their characteristics. Given vast spatial and temporal complexities in a typical SEES, it becomes necessary to enhance the physical power network with just-in-time (JIT), just-in-place (JIP), and just-in-context (JIC) functionalities. These, in turn, support sustainable energy services by aligning temporal, spatial, and contextual characteristics of resources and users. We refer to the ICT implementation in support of these functionalities as dynamic monitoring and decision systems (DYMONDS). The tradeoffs between the ability of the SEES to ensure sustainable services and the complexity of the supporting smart grid are discussed for several representative energy system architectures.   \n",

The proposed topology splits one of the switches on each phase-leg of a conventional inverter into two half-voltage rated switches, and creates two complementary sets of balanced three phase output voltages, whose common mode voltages cancel each other in the driven motor, and is named as “balanced inverter”. The balanced inverter topology does not involve additional passive components, modification of the modulation strategy, or increase of the total device rating. Theoretical analysis, simulation, and testing results are presented to verify this concept.   \n",

Based on the polynomial transformation technique, an extended least-squares (ELS) algorithm is designed to estimate parameters of the mixed-rate model, from which parameters of the fast-rate model is extracted. Convergence properties of the ELS algorithm are analyzed, and the parameter identifiability is ensured if the plant output sampling rate is non-integer multiples of the controller sampling rate. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulation results on the head-positioning servo control system of a hard disk drive (HDD) during track-following mode, where no external PE signal is added on.   \n",

The library loan records of a certain university library for the period 2006 to 2011 were used. We recommended books to 33 students and asked them to describe the books' level of interest. The results show that books recommended by collaborative filtering were least favorably evaluated, followed by those recommended by association rule and Amazon. Collaborative filtering carries the risk of breaching users' privacy and its computational costs are higher compared to those of association rule mining. Therefore, if we recommend books based on library loan records, association rule mining should be adopted instead of collaborative filtering. In addition, given the fact that the recommendations by Amazon were most favorably evaluated, utilization of Amazon should also be considered.   \n",

In this case, a real auction system is needed to help auctioneer finish auction process. The agent technology also is researched by more and more scholars and experts and is applied to in all fields. So, this paper present interactive multi-attribute reverse auction system based on agent technology and study new Evaluation bidding model by decision-making method of multi-attribute based on EWAA operator and LHA operator when the weight of attribute is real number. Auction intermediary is the center in this system and evaluation bids system is designed based on black box theory. This system not only can improve auction efficiency, but also ensure fair in evaluation bidding process.   \n",

Since degradation caused by the transform and the quantization is difficult to describe mathematically, a clustering technique is used to analyze the statistics of the source and noise in the training. Then, coefficients of a linear prediction filter are pre-calculated and stored in a codebook. In the decoding stage, the linear filter with proper coefficients is applied to quantized transform coefficients and to pixels at block boundaries after the inverse DCT. Experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently reduce coding artifacts with a low computational complexity.   \n",

With those concepts a new algorithm based on Graphplan is presented. A lot of restrictions make the Graphplan planner far from the real world. The new algorithm inherits all the capabilities of Graphplan. Except this, it also adapted to other situations. For a problem, if Graphplan can't find a solution implementing all the goals, the new method outputs a best sub-optimal solution, which can implement part of goals. And these partial goals can satisfy user as much as possible. In many complex circumstances, relaxing partial rigid restrictions can solve a problem more expressive and more effective   \n",

A novel dual-rate data-driven algorithm based on lifting technology and reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed. First, a dual-rate flotation process model including the device layer and the operational models is formulated. Then, a proportional integral (PI) controller for device layer is designed, by using lifting technology, a unified timescale controlled plant model with partially unknown dynamics is established. Based on such a model, an online learning algorithm using neural network is presented so that the operational indices, namely concentrate and tail grades, can be kept in the target range while maintaining the setpoints of the device layer within the specified bounds. At last, emulation experiments in a hardware-in-the-loop system are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.   \n",

In this paper, a prototype system exploiting a do it yourself quad copter drone for delivering products is proposed. On the one hand, the hardware choices made in order to limit risks arising from autonomous delivery are presented. On the other hand, a framework for orders placement and shipment is shown. The advantages of a system like the one described in this paper are mainly related to an increased delivery speed, especially in urban contexts with traffic, to the possibility to make deliveries in areas usually difficult to be reached, and to the drone's ability to autonomously carry out consignments. A practical use case, in which the proposed system is used for delivering drugs (an application in which the need to quickly receive the good might be particularly important) is shown. Nevertheless, the proposed prototype could be employed in other contexts, such as take-away deliveries, product shipments, registered mail consignments, etc.   \n",

The formation of electrets in these materials under different conditions of sample temperatures polarizing fields and cooling rates will be experimentally pursued. The decay of these electrets both in the open circuit and closed circuit conditions are to be observed (with improved methods whenever possible). An extension of the Swann-Gubkin theory to a more elaborate microscopic theory in agreement with the experimental observations will be sought.   \n",

By attaching the core-shell nanoparticle to the disk resonator with gold core and polymer shell, the coupling between the disk resonator and the core-shell nanoparticle results in shift of the resonance wavelength of the disk resonator, depending on the core size/shell thickness of the nanoparticle. An invisibility phenomena found from the coupled core-shell nanoparticle and integrated disk resonator system is emphasized; at certain core size/shell thickness ratio, compared with the original resonance wavelength without core-shell nanoparticle, there is almost no resonance wavelength shift observed. The detailed interaction mechanism between the disk resonator and the nanoparticle is revealed in the electromagnetic field intensity distribution at the resonator resonance wavelength. The dependence of the position and number of core-shell nanoparticles is also discussed. Future studies on this coupled photonic systems will stimulate wide variety of applications.   \n",

Designs in which the diode ohmic anode has an overhanging Schottky extension (composite anode contact) are shown to result in a significantly reduced amount of impact ionization, as compared with a simple ohmic contact design. The EL results are consistent with Monte Carlo simulations, which show a reduced impact ionization in composite anode contact devices due to a reduced electron density beneath the anode Schottky extension that, on the one hand, weakens the Gunn domain electric field and softens its variations near the anode edge, and, on the other hand, reduces the number of electrons capable of generating holes by impact ionization. A comparison between standard and composite anode contact approaches in terms of radio-frequency operation of the devices is made showing oscillations up to 109 GHz with an output power of -5 dBm in devices featuring the composite anode contact and no oscillations from all-ohmic contact devices. The findings reported in this paper may be useful not only for the design and the fabrication of planar Gunn diodes but also for other devices such as high-electron-mobility transistors where impact ionization can result in reliability limitations.   \n",

However, the standard TR-UWB scheme, while often motivated by the simplicity of its receiver, is still dogged by implementation concerns. In particular, the receiver requires an extremely wideband delay element, which is difficult to incorporate into low-power integrated systems. In this paper, a TR scheme is proposed in which the separation between the data and reference signals, rather than being a time delay, is a slow rotation over the symbol interval. This provides a (slightly) frequency-shifted reference that, while orthogonal to the data-bearing pulse, still goes through a nearly equal channel. A detailed analysis of the proposed scheme is provided. Simulation results demonstrate the expected result that frequency shifting of the reference in the proposed manner is not effective for high-data-rate systems that experience appreciable intersymbol interference. However, for the targeted low-to-moderate data-rate applications, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system not only achieves the primary goal of providing a much simpler receiver architecture, but also that it outperforms the standard TR-UWB system   \n",

Previously, we have demonstrated the noise-robust performance of the predictive ESN classifier in automatic speech recognition experiments in which the network was trained to predict the next frame of speech features. Classification performance was limited because the predictive models lacked discriminability, so we changed the model output to a one-of-many output encoding scheme and trained the model discriminatively. Performance was compared to a hidden Markov model (HMM) in small-vocabulary ASR experiments with additive noise. Accuracy of 50% was achieved by a discriminative ESN classifier at -8.5 dB SNR, compared to 0.4 dB SNR for a predictive ESN classifier and 6.6 dB SNR for an HMM. With discriminative training, a larger reservoir was employed for the discriminative ESN classifier compared to the predictive ESN classifier which resulted a larger memory depth and more noise-robust performance.   \n",

The surface roughness of devices was controlled by inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching. Using this fabrication method to form nano-scaled roughness, the electrical property was almost not degraded. Furthermore, the light-output power and wall-plug efficiency of LLO LED could be both significantly enhanced about two times using this simple method   \n",

Integration is facilitated with accurate short-term forecasts of wind power. The paper presents a spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting algorithm that incorporates the time series data of a target station and data of surrounding stations. Inspired by Compressive Sensing (CS) and structured-sparse recovery algorithms, we claim that there usually exists an intrinsic low-dimensional structure governing a large collection of stations that should be exploited. We cast the forecasting problem as recovery of a block-sparse signal x from a set of linear equations b = Ax for which we propose novel structure-sparse recovery algorithms. Results of a case study in the east coast show that the proposed Compressive Spatio-Temporal Wind Speed Forecasting (CSTWSF) algorithm significantly improves the short-term forecasts compared to a set of widely-used benchmark models.   \n",

Specifically, we explore reactions and interactions of persons facing a mobile robot from a robot centric view. This new perspective offers social awareness to the robots, enabling interesting applications. As far as we know, there is no public 3D dataset for this problem. Therefore, we record two multi-modal first-person RGBD datasets that reflect the setting we are analyzing. We use a humanoid and a non-humanoid robot equipped with a Kinect. Notably, the videos contain a high percentage of ego-motion due to the robot self-exploration as well as its reactions to the persons' interactions. We show that separating the descriptors extracted from ego-motion and independent motion areas, and using them both, allows us to achieve superior recognition results. Experiments show that our algorithm recognizes the activities effectively and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on related tasks.   \n",

A general scenario where both systems are allowed to select between amplify-and-forward relaying and decode-and-forward relaying is studied. We adopt a game-theoretic approach and show that once both systems act non-cooperatively to optimize their own rate, they can always reach a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) from an arbitrary starting point in a totally distributed and asynchronous manner. We also provide insights on the impacts of network topology and relaying protocols on the sum rate performance of the NE through extensive numerical results.   \n",

Electrical behaviors of PZT-based and Si:HfO\\n2\\n-based NC-FETs are investigated and discussed. In a PZT-based p-type NC-FET, a sub-thermal swing down to 20mV/dec is achieved due to the remarkable voltage gain of NC, reaching a maximum value of 10V/V. Nevertheless, the performance improvements with Si:Hf5O\\n2\\n NC booster are significantly lower than PZT due to the coexistence of different phases and also high leakage current which can enormously reduce the enhancement by NC.   \n",

Automated data collection systems are effective, but they can encourage collecting only data that is easily available. The Fixed Switching unit from Nokia has automated data collection systems supporting its processes. It started measurement based improvement of the fault management process by defining goal-driven metrics on top of the existing systems. Fault management includes the analysis and correction of faults, and the delivery of corrections. The work consisted of translating high-level goals into measurement goals, applying the Goal-Question-Metric paradigm to identify questions and indicators, and identifying needed data. Starting with a workshop setting helped to get practitioners involved. Having specified measurement goals helped defining concrete metrics that are targeted at specific audiences. The defined metrics serve the purposes of monitoring fault traffic, and process improvement. Metrics need to evolve, and the metrics implemented first use only data from the fault tracking system, providing the best reporting facilities at the moment. However, metrics that require qualitative checking of data cannot be automated.   \n",

The ultra-high quality factor (Q) makes them promising ranging from sensors, filters to low threshold sources. In the above supplications, the frequency stability of the WGM is critical, which is determined by several factors. In this paper, using the microsphere resonator we construct a robust packaged microsphere-taper coupling system (MTCS) to stabilize the resonant WGMs. Furthermore, a stable frequency references platform based on the packaged microcavity unit is constructed. This stable frequency references platform can eliminate the noise of the WGM, and promote the microresonator researches.   \n",

Mutual coupling between array elements is accounted for with the formulation of an active impedance matrix equation for each of the domains/array elements. The active current distribution on the entire array geometry is then obtained by solving these smaller matrix equations pertaining to the elements. The active impedance matrix calculation entails a summation of the MoM matrix diagonal and off-diagonal sub-matrices. For arrays containing a large number of elements this summation can lead to matrix fill times similar to that of the global MoM calculation. To mitigate this significant computational overhead, while still maintaining a sufficient degree of accuracy, the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) algorithm is applied to accelerate this part of the DGFM.   \n",

The procedure is based on the transfer matrix method and utilizes a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm for the solution of the resulting transcendental equations. By applying a semi-analytical approach, the algorithm shows very good convergence behavior even for structures containing metallic layers. Analytic forms of the transcendental equations for transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarization for systems with one to four boundaries are presented. Conducting interfaces can, for instance, be used to describe a 2-D electron gas or a planar metamaterial. We demonstrate the performance of this method by examples which are of current technological interest. These include surface waves bound to surface carriers on p-InAs, a parallel plate waveguide and plasma oscillations in a high electron mobility transistor structure.   \n",

It is useful in applications to data mining, conflict analysis, and so on. Although ignored by much of the related work, the high rate and unbounded nature of data make the sliding window indispensable. In this paper, we present a fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm over sliding window for the missing value imputation of incomplete data to improve the data quality. The experiments show that our missing data imputation algorithm tends to be more tolerant of imprecision and uncertainty and can lead to a better performance with accuracy guarantees.   \n",

Although event detection has been actively studied, most of the existing approaches do not address the issue of efficient event monitoring in the presence of a large number of events detected from continuous tweet streams. In this paper, we capture the dynamics of events using four event operations: creation, absorption, split and merge.We also propose a novel event indexing structure, named Multi-layer Inverted List (MIL), for the acceleration of large-scale event search and update. We thoroughly study the problem of nearest neighbour search using MIL based on upper bound pruning. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale tweet dataset. The results demonstrate the promising performance of our method in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.   \n",

In [1], the authors proposed a method for improving cross-range resolution for a given Deltathetas by use of frequency diverse array (FDA) techniques. The goal was to exploit an apparent increase in Deltathetas to improve cross-range resolution while retaining benefits of shorter synthetic apertures and integration times using a linear FDA. This paper extends those efforts and introduces the application of FDA techniques to improve range resolution.   \n",

This grating is unique in that it is written such that the time delay as a function of wavelength is a third-order profile that covers several WDM channels over a continuous bandwidth of many nanometers. The dispersion range provided by the grating for the WDM channels can be up to 400 ps/nm, enabling dispersion slope compensation.   \n",

In MLR networks, end-to-end lightpaths can be established with the desired line rate; requiring advanced modulation formats for higher data rates. However, along the route, the signals experience different physical layer impairments (PLIs), and their quality also worsens. The transmission signal quality is affected by the launch power, which must be high for lesser noise at the receiver, and must also be low, such that the PLIs do not start to distort the signal. Further, higher launch power also disrupts the existing lightpath and its neighbours. We propose a weighted strategy for provisioning PLI-aware (PLI-A) lightpaths in MLR networks. Through the simulations, we compare and demonstrate that the proposed strategy demonstrates better performances than our previously proposed algorithm (i.e. PLI-Average (PLI-A)), and existing approaches.   \n",

Drucker (1993) said that knowledge would be the only competitive resource for companies in the future. This is an era in which knowledge plays a dominant role in our daily business lives. Intellectual capital has gradually taken the place of traditional tangible capital in many business organizations. However, practitioners are often puzzled about where they stand, how well they are doing, and what they should do next. This paper aims to construct a knowledge management maturity model as a means to help answer these and related questions. There are three components in the proposed model: maturity levels, knowledge management processes, and knowledge management capabilities or enabling infrastructures. The maturity levels are based on the capability maturity model (CMM) of SEI. This model divides the knowledge management process into four main sub-processes: knowledge creation, knowledge storage, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application, emphasizing the need for continuous process improvement. Furthermore, knowledge management enablers are integrated into KMMM to describe how it supports the practices at each maturity level. The applicability of this model is evaluated through case studies, which also serve to illustrate how knowledge management practices among organizations are compared, and what maturity paths organizations can follow. Three banks were taken for cases study through in depth interview with their senior managements. By analyzing data gathered through the process described above, the conclusion of this study is induced.   \n",

Using a two layer optimization technique the daily load profile of the railway station is reduced in order to increase the load factor and minimizing the annual energy invoice (AEI) of the station. Binary linear programming is used as second layer for charging/discharging scheduling problem. The final results shows interests of using the proposed approach conducting its impact on minimizing annual optimum subscribed power, maximum demand power and annual energy invoice.   \n",

We show that the system dynamics are differentially flat. We utilize the differential flatness of the system to provide a feed forward input. The system model derived allows for arbitrary changes in yaw and is not limited to small roll and pitch angles. We demonstrate in hardware the ability to follow a highly maneuverable path while tracking a time-varying heading command.   \n",

In addition, the nonlinear normalization model is adopted to provide more accurate position before matching. Moreover, an effective iris segmentation method is proposed to refine the detected inner and outer boundaries to smooth curves. For feature extraction, the Gabor filters are adopted to detect the local feature points from the segmented iris image in the Cartesian coordinate system and to generate a rotation-invariant descriptor for each detected point. After that, the proposed matching algorithm is used to compute a similarity score for two sets of feature points from a pair of iris images. The experimental results show that the performance of our system is better than those of the systems based on the local features and is comparable to those of the typical systems.   \n",

We carry out vibration analysis of a single phase of a reactor while considering electromagnetism and magnetostriction to clarify the mechanism of noise generation in the reactor. In this analysis, magnetostriction is modeled three-dimensionally with equivalent nodal forces. First, the nodal forces in the cores of reactor due to the electromagetism and magnetostriction are calculated using the flux distribution obtained from magnetic field analysis. To determine the dominant cause of noise, the spatial distributions of displacements generated by both nodal forces are then obtained by static structure analysis and they are compared in detail. Moreover, the actual movements of the cores are calculated by vibration analysis. Finally, the effect of the hardness of the cores on noise generation is calculated and measured. It is shown that the hardness of the insulator inserted in gaps between cores affects the vibration and it seems to have an optimal value. Moreover, the analyzed results are proved by measurement.   \n",

EEG signals were recorded from three reference electrodes (Fz, C3, and C4) and from six additional electrodes located close to the reference electrodes. The performance of four different feature extraction methods [power spectral density (PSD), phase locking value (PLV), a combination of PSD and PLV, and cross-correlation (CC)] were evaluated in terms of robustness to electrode location changes as well as regarding absolute classification accuracy. The quantitative evaluation results demonstrated that the use of either PSD- or CC-based features led to higher classification accuracy than the use of PLV-based features, whereas PSD-based features showed much higher sensitivity to changes in EEG electrode location than CC- or PLV-based features. There results suggest that CC can be a promising feature extraction method in motor-imagery-based BCI studies as it provides high classification accuracy along with being little affected by slight changes in the EEG electrode locations.   \n",

The surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) exited by light on metallic nano grooves arrays (NGA) and nanowires (NWs), play a role of an intermediary between photonics and electronics. We report on the experimental demonstration of polarization controlled SPP propagation, leading to tailored directional coupling in a periodic plasmonic NGAs and NWs. The SPP emission and propagation, in Au NGAs and Au NWs is modulated by the incident light polarization. Our results establish a basis for the developments of innovative optical devices, which are useful in telecommunications and other nanophotonic devices.   \n",

The invasive nature of the rectal sensor used to collect CBT makes it difficult to use in ambulatory conditions. Here we validate the use of a newly developed brain temperature (BT) sensor against that of a standard rectal temperature sensor using a 72-hour ultra-rapid sleep-wake (URSW) cycle procedure. A significant circadian variation of both body temperature recordings was observed from which a phase and amplitude was reliably determined. These results indicate that BT can be refined as a non-invasive alternative to CBT measurements in the evaluation of circadian phase in field conditions.   \n",

This paper presents a scalability analysis for hysteresis couplers. After a brief re-call of the performance evaluation method, several design optimizations based on finite element analysis, simplified hysteresis model and stochastic algorithms are carried out in order to analyze the effects of the external radial dimensions in the design of hysteresis couplers and draw general design guidelines.   \n",

However, its body diode has comparatively high forward voltage; therefore, the diode conduction loss generated during dead time increases. As a result, the loss reduction by the use of the SiC MOSFET can be weakened. This paper proposes a simple dead-time controller integrated in an isolated gate driver in order to reduce the diode conduction loss during the dead time. The proposed method has high speed and high robustness against switching noise by using of a current-sense FET with small parasitic capacitance. As a result, the diode conduction time can be shortened within 0.1 μs. In addition, the proposed dead-time control method can be achieved by existing components, including the current-sense FET, which is currently used for short-circuit current detection in hybrid vehicle applications. The proposed method was applied to a 10 kW boost converter with SiC MOSFET. The experimental results showed 1% higher efficiency of the converter with the proposed dead-time-controlled gate driver compared to that without dead-time control circuit, and the efficiency was the similar level as when a SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) was used as FWDs.   \n",

It can greatly reduce the memory access latency. So the cache hit rate has a significant impact on the performance of the application. Many processors provide cache locking mechanism, which can lock the certain lines in cache. It enables an application to affect the cache replacement decisions under software control. This paper presents a novel method, which uses cache locking mechanism to reduce the run-time of java virtual machine (JVM). JVM often uses just-in-time compiler (JIT) to improve the performance. JIT compiles the method that has been invoked certain times, and then JVM executes the compiled method when invoking this method the next time. This paper analyzes the calling situation of the compiled method in JVM, and then proposes a heuristic approach to lock the compiled method in cache for an appropriate period. It can reduce cache miss rate when JVM executes the compiled method. The algorithm has been implemented in HotSpot based on Loongson-3A. Also, it can be implemented in other run-time systems. Experiment results show that the cache locking heuristic algorithm averagely reduces the cache miss rate by 8.5%, and improves the performance by 4% on the benchmark SPECjvm2008.   \n",

Intuitively, annotations provide evidence for the class label, and the class label provides evidence for annotations. For example, an image of class highway is more likely annotated with words “road,” “car,” and “traffic” than words “fish,” “boat,” and “scuba.” In this paper, we develop a new probabilistic model for jointly modeling the image, its class label, and its annotations. Our model treats the class label as a global description of the image, and treats annotation terms as local descriptions of parts of the image. Its underlying probabilistic assumptions naturally integrate these two sources of information. We derive an approximate inference and estimation algorithms based on variational methods, as well as efficient approximations for classifying and annotating new images. We examine the performance of our model on two real-world image data sets, illustrating that a single model provides competitive annotation performance, and superior classification performance.   \n",

Methods: This study is about the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical research for influenza A (H1N1) therapy of the special project of TCM Industry. We used two methods for double data entry, and randomly selected 50 cases from two databases using two different data entry methods, respectively. We verified each variable with the original case report forms, recorded every error, and analyzed the reason of mistakes. Results: The error rates of the Interactive Double Data Entry verification was 15.17 per 10,000 data items (fields). The error rate of the consistent verification was 1.18 per 10,000 data items (fields). The interactive verification's error rate was significantly higher than the consistent verification (P <; 0.05). Conclusions: The error rates of the consistency check were lower than the interactive verification under the same condition, interactive verification was more suitable for data in large clinical research, limited time and case analyzing required right after verification. Experienced data entry operators who are familiar with the contents of data, and have rigorous attitude are the keys to guarantee high quality data no matter what methods are chosen.   \n",

On the one hand, perceptual learning is more and more studied in neurobiology and is now considered as an essential part of any living system. In fact, perceptual learning and cognitive learning are both necessary for learning and often depend on each other. On the other hand, many works in machine learning are concerned with \"abstraction\" in order to reduce the amount of complexity related to some learning tasks. In the abstraction framework, perceptual learning can be seen as a specific process that learns how to transform the data before the traditional learning task itself takes place. In this paper, we argue that biologically inspired perceptual learning mechanisms could be used to build efficient low-level abstraction operators that deal with real-world data. To illustrate this, we present an application where perceptual-learning-inspired metaoperators are used to perform an abstraction on an autonomous robot visual perception. The goal of this work is to enable the robot to learn how to identify objects it encounters in its environment.   \n",

Firstly, the PSO algorithm is put forward to determine not only the input variables but also the structure of the RRBF effectively. Secondly, the gradient descent method is used to adjust the weights, center and width. Finally, the soft-measurement model is applied to the actual sewage treatment process. The experimental results show that the soft-measurement model has a more compact structure and its accuracy is improved compared with other models.   \n",

The research on existing literature of such network show evidence of plenty of algorithms and models that can estimate hop count based on connectivity without considering mobility of the network. Therefore in this paper, an algorithm is proposed for evaluating the average hop count and illustrates the effect of hop count on path reliability for various scenario metrics such as network size, network coverage area, transmission range of the mobile nodes considering mobility of mobile nodes. The methodology uses Random Way Point Mobility Model to locate the spatial distribution of mobile nodes. Finally the simulated results are used to examine the network average hop count and path reliability through extensive simulations. The results show that the maximum path reliability with an optimum hop count can be obtained with suitable choice of network size within a selected coverage area of the networks that are operable in harsh environment.   \n",

Spectrum sensing is one of the basic components of CR technology. Energy sensing, matched filtering sensing and cyclostationary sensing are three classical methods for spectrum sensing in CR networks, but all of them still have some defects. In this paper, phototropism in biology is introduced and “light source” model is established for spectrum sensing in CR networks, and a new spectrum sensing technology is researched based on the phototropism. After comparing the commonness and difference between plant growth and spectrum sensing process, a multi-threshold spectrum sensing algorithm based on the phototropism principle for cognitive radio is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the performance of the spectrum sensing in CR networks, compared with three classical methods.   \n",

Hence, the concept of System Wide Information Management (SWIM) has been promoted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to implement interoperability and harmonization in global operation. In the SWIM environment, all the related stakeholders need to efficiently obtain the necessary ATM data with situational awareness from various information domains. However, this is difficult to realize in the current system, as different data are structured based on different data models. In this study, we construct domain ontologies based on flight, aeronautical, and weather information exchange models. Further, we develop a common ontology that uniformly defines the inconsistent representation in terms of the 4D, 3D, and 2D concepts and their inclusion relations and propose an integration method for heterogeneous domain ontologies. Moreover, we apply the proposed ontologies to a SWIM test system. The applicability and efficiency of the proposal are demonstrated through a case study in the SWIM environment.   \n",

We introduce a fast algorithm for choosing gates for sizing and voltage scaling such that the total power is minimized under delay constraints. We also use a more accurate estimate for determining the power dissipation of the circuit by taking into account the short circuit power along with the dynamic power. A better model of the short circuit power is used which takes into account the loading capacitance of the gates. Our results show that the combination of VS and GS perform better than the techniques applied in isolation. An average power reduction of 73% is obtained when decisions are taken assuming dynamic power only. In contrast, average power reduction is 77% when decisions include the short circuit power dissipation.   \n",

In certain applications, under- actuated systems are unavoidable. For instance, a biped can not have an actuator between the foot and the ground. In industrial robots, under-actuation can minimize cost and dead weight. Differential flatness, if applicable, provides a systematic approach to plan and control feasible trajectories for such systems. Recently, the authors have formulated a philosophy to design under-actuated planar manipulators that are differentially flat [1]. The design philosophy has two sufficient conditions: (i) an inertia distribution scheme, and (ii) an actuator and torque spring placement scheme. The philosophy covers a broad range of n-DOF manipulator designs with the degree of under- actuation varying from 1 to n - 1 as opposed to under-actuation by one or two in most of the literature on under-actuated manipulators. This paper presents a 3-DOF planar manipulator designed on the basis of this philosophy and an experimental study of controllers based on its differential flatness property. It is demonstrated experimentally that the differential flatness based controllers are able to track the desired trajectories with small tracking errors even in the presence disturbances like friction, parameter uncertainty etc. It is shown via simulation that the errors observed in the trajectories can be attributed to the friction present at the unactuated joint.   \n",

Despite the suggestions of many experts against their use, several empirical studies have shown that pie charts are at least as good as alternatives. From Brinton to Few on one side and Eells to Kosara on the other, there appears to have been a hundred-year war waged on the humble pie. In this paper a set of experiments are reported that compare the performance of pie charts and horizontal bar charts with various visual cues. Amazon's Mechanical Turk service was employed to perform the tasks of estimating segments in various part-to-whole charts. The results lead to recommendations for data visualization professionals in developing dashboards.   \n",

The proposed system considers a multidomain electrochemical, fluidic, and thermal dynamic modeling and it is experimentally validated against a SOFC real world implementation. Implicit iterative algebraic equations have been introduced and implemented in C language in order to have fast real-time execution. The methodology for implementing such an iterative solver is discussed in details and the results demonstrate practical feasibilities in advancing real-time control of SOFC.   \n",

Unfortunately, they suffer from unfiltered switching noise, also known as ripple, whose amplitude increases for progressively lower self-oscillating frequency. Moreover, such self-oscillating frequency changes with the input signal and its dependency curve, as well as its maximum, are determined by the overall loop delay and by the open-loop filter. To remedy this SOPAs' pitfall, this paper presents a method to increase the self-oscillation frequency and reduce frequency modulation for a fixed propagation delay and loop filter. This is achieved using a relay that exhibits a novel kind of hysteresis. For that, the theory of its working principle will be discussed in detail, its transfer characteristic will be defined, and an implementation suitable for VLSI will be proposed. To validate the concept, simulations and an experimental prototype were carried out to compare the behavior of existing types of SOPA with the proposed one.   \n",

The electrical characterization and results in acute experiments with rats are presented. The main characteristics are: low noise (5 nV/sub rms///spl radic/Hz), high CMRR (>90 dB), programmable gain (77 dB-103 dB), bandpass from 100 Hz to 5 kHz and tolerance to the input offset greater than /spl plusmn/50 mV. In order to implement the low cut-off frequency of the band pass filter, an active resistor of 80 M/spl Omega/ value has been designed with programmable tuning.   \n",

An optimization algorithm was designed and programmed for the design of an ET that also includes water reservoirs, pipes, and pumps. The algorithm is a variant of the block coordinate descent method, where one subproblem is formulated as a linear programming problem, and a second subproblem usually has an analytic solution. If the analytic solution is nonfeasible, a variant of the quasi-Newton algorithm is used instead. The algorithm was tested with input information from the arid area near Eilat, the Red Sea, Israel.   \n",

The proposed converters allow us to feed the load voltage with sinusoidal voltages with constant amplitude and frequency and to operate with sinusoidal grid current with a high power factor. The converters can then be used as uninterruptible power supplies and unified power quality conditioners for nonregenerative applications. The system model, space-vector pulse width modulation technique, and a complete control system are given. A method to regulate the dc-link voltages using the voltage vector redundancies is presented. The proposed topologies are compared with the conventional one in terms of operation range, capability to operate with a unity grid power factor, voltage harmonic distortions, semiconductor losses, and others characteristics. Simulation and experimental results in many operating conditions are provided to validate the feasibility of the system.   \n",

In this work the results of experimental tests of organic oxidation by ozone, which are amplified by electrical discharges or ultrasound are presented. Circuit diagrams of water purification from surfactants and organic pollutants (OP) are given. Model solutions of sodium lauryl sulfate, as SA, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, as OP are used. The regularities of the influence of pH in the process of electrodischarge and cavitation treatment of OS solutions in the presence of ozone on the quantitative indicators of their destruction were established. The influence of the duration of the treatment process on the persistence of contaminants. The oxidation process was investigated at various concentrations of the initial materials. It has been established that the destruction of surfactants and drugs proceeds better when ozone is combined with the effects of electropulse, at high pH values.   \n",

We proposed first the preprocessing of each image acquired in real scenario, the preprocessing is realized in two steps, the first is to crop each flower to create a database with the tag of each subtype, the second consist in removing the background using color space transformation to Hue and filter the image according to some specific values. With all the images a decision tree is created with the 70% of the images in each category, the first rule consists of identify the highest value in the histogram, if this value corresponds to green range or orange range the classification is done, nevertheless if the value corresponds to pink, the enclosing circles are estimated, then the color into the smallest circles defined the classification. The evaluation is performed using the last 30% of the images in each category, the classification will be positive if the correct subtype is predicted, if not the classification will be negative, nevertheless the classifier could predict no class based on any existence of the flower, or different flower, in this case if non-class is predicted over a different flower the classification will be positive, if not the classification will be negative.

Women, Hispanic/Latinx, Black/African American, and Native American students are minorities in CSE majors. Most universities and organizations have worked on outreach activities to these underrepresented minorities (URM). In this context, this paper presents a systematic literature mapping on educational initiatives in higher education for retention of Hispanic/Latinx students in CSE majors reported in the last ten years (2009-2018). The methodology was based on a systematic literature review protocol using four academic databases: Scopus, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore. We found 76 papers about educational initiatives in CSE majors to retain URM students that include Hispanic/Latinx students. We classify the papers to get relevant information about institutions, type of educational initiatives, main conferences, and present these findings in this paper.   \n",

In this study a manifold learning algorithm is first used to obtain multi-images matching results, on which a globally mosaic image coordinate system is then iteratively achieved and utilized to calculate global registration parameters of each image. Testing results indicate that the proposed method has a higher performance than traditional frame-to-frame registration methods in the error accumulation and registration accuracy of mosaic images.   \n",

This paper examines the leakage current distribution originating from the high voltage conductor to various locations through the wooden pole of various age profiles. The specimens that are investigated in this paper range from a new sample to an aged pole sample of more than 20 years in service. The main results show that the aging effect on the wooden pole has great effect on the wood resistance. The decaying of the wood reduces the wood resistance and thus increases the leakage current. Thermal images showing heating of the king bolt due to leakage currents are also presented.   \n",

Several Electronic Travel Aids are proposed in the literature, and the methodology is evaluated by placing different types of the obstacle, traveling through them blindfolded, and counting the number of times obstacles are detected or not by the system. In our view, this approach helps little for further advancing the current system as the experimental scenario is not repeatable entirely and makes it difficult to compare new research findings with any existing one. We therefore, present a model inspired by the real world settings for detecting low-lying obstacles, considering few assumptions and constraints. The simulations are also proposed based on the model to generate obstacle data any number of time. Furthermore, to validate our model and simulations, field experiments are conducted, and the results obtained are compared with the simulation result. The evaluation parameter in terms of standard deviation, accuracy, false positive, errors encountered suggest that the proposed model and simulations effectively encapsulates the real-world parameters and thus can be explored and utilized further by the research community.   \n",

The GPSM scheme proposed recently is a new multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmission technique, which conveys information by activating a subset of receive antennas with the aid of transmit pre-coding. This scheme seems to be suitable in V2X since the base station only transmits data to certain users/vehicles. The proposed pre-coding matrix is based on the lattice reduction (LR) principle and provides significant performance improvement over the original pre-coding design in GPSM. Furthermore, as the GPSM in large-scale antenna systems, which is a trend in future communication systems, might be too complex to be implemented with the maximum likelihood (ML) detection, a linear decoding method is proposed to reduce the implementation complexity. Our studies show that the performance degradation caused by the linear detector can be compensated by the proposed LR based pre-coding. As a result, the LR based GPSM with linear detection is capable of achieving the comparable performance as that of the original GPSM scheme employing ML detection, while with significantly decreased detection complexity.   \n",

These include a global GEO MSS system, Inmarsat, and domestic GEO MSS systems such as North-American AMSC, Japan's N-Star and the Australian Mobilesat. At present, two types of antennas can be used to access GEO MSS services. They include (1) fixed position antennas, which are used with portable transceivers; and (2) fully mobile antennas such as those installed on a land vehicle. The fixed position antennas are relatively easy to design, as they have to meet a moderate (approximately 7%) operational bandwidth and a medium (about 10 dBi) gain. There are a number of complete portable systems in the commercial market that include both a transceiver and an antenna. One inconvenience of portable systems is that they require the user be stationary with respect to the ground. This inconvenience can be overcome with a mobile antenna system. The design of such a system is more challenging as new features associated with mobility have to be incorporated. This paper presents the development and performance of a circular phased array antenna for land vehicle mobile satellite communications. This antenna is specifically aimed for use with the Australian MSS, Mobilesat. However, it can easily be modified for use with the other L-band GEO MSS systems.   \n",

GSVD facilitates joint decomposition of a class of matrices arising inherently in source-to-2 destination MIMO broadcast scenarios. GSVD allows two channels of suitable dimensionality to be jointly diagonalized, i.e. to be reduced to non-interfering virtual broadcast channels, through the use of jointly determined transmit precoding and receiver reconstruction matrices. Potential applications for GSVD-based beamforming can be found in MIMO broadcasting, as well as in MIMO relaying under all amplify-and-forward, decode-and-forward, and code-and-forward relay processing schemes. Several of them are highlighted here. We also present simulation-based performance analysis results to justify the use of GSVD for coordinated beamforming.   \n",

This is seen as one of the approaches which might lead to eventual standardization of digital representation of distribution systems and operating software for this purpose.   \n",

The self-designed single-mode generator is constructed in the form of a matrix of acoustic monopoles and is capable to generate a selected single mode. The scattering matrix formalism is a new approach to analyse the acoustical systems containing one or more duct-like elements (joints) connected by some undefined elements such as, for example, acoustic mufflers of different types and so the formalism is frequently applied to analyse the phenomena of noise reduction in such systems. Experimental derivation of the scattering matrix for a wave composed of N modes demands, in general, excitation of N different sound fields at each side of the two-port first. Finally the matrix composed of the modal pressures measurements obtained for each of the exited fields must be inversed to obtain the scattering matrix. Generating single N modes the matrix of the incoming pressure data is, theoretically, diagonal which makes derivation of the scattering matrix much easier. Generation of independent sound fields in the shape of single modes ensures the matrix to be well conditioned.   \n",

The proposed RCC receiver adopts a signal transmitted technique via amplitude modulation (AM) principle. This I/Q DPS adopts a multi-phase sampled technique using a multi-phase ring oscillator. The decoding circuit can amplify the input signal and filter the noise signal to achieve high quality signal source. The low noise amplifier (LNA) circuit can receive the smaller input power. The operational frequency of all-digital clock generator (ADCG) is programmable for the broadcast frequency of local communication systems, such as the DCF77 (Germany), WWVB (US), JJY (Japan), BPC (CN), and MSF (UK). The digital loop filter of ADCG adopts a successive-approximation register (SAR) algorithm for fast locking time. This RCC receiver is implemented in a 0.18 um CMOS process and the core area of RCC receiver is 1152 × 1572 μm\\n2\\n. The accuracies of operational frequencies of ADCG are less than ±264 ppm for all radio broadcasting frequencies. The voltage gain of LNA is 24.44 dB to achieve the lower input power. The measured environment of clock/alarm application is set and verified for the test chip of RCC receiver.   \n",

Although NASA's Human-Powered Lunar Rover Design Competition was used as the \"vehicle\" for the course development, the main impetus was to provide a true multidisciplinary design experience for both engineering and nonengineering students. Groups of students from the different majors were formed to design and analyze major components of the Lunar Rover. Teamwork within and between the groups was emphasized since the various components had to be integrated to form the final design. An interesting aspect of the course was to treat the two human drivers as one of the major components. This resulted in a complete engineering analysis of the performance characteristics of the students to determine the best choice of drivers (i.e., \"engines\"). To enhance the multidisciplinary experience, technical assistance and/or financial support was provided by the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Science Department as well as the Geology and Exercise Science Departments. The students completed the design, built the rover, and successfully participated in the NASA sponsored competition. Despite an initial hesitance to work with students outside their major, the class came together as a team.

Thus, in the present paper, we develop analytically a methodology for the state changing of a linear control descriptor differential system based also on a linear combination of Dirac δ-function and its derivatives. Using linear algebra techniques and the generalized inverse theory, the input’s coefficients are determined. In our practical numerical application, the Dirac distribution is approximated by the normal probability distribution.   \n",

This bidirectional configuration shares optical components in the fiber network and an interleaver is utilized to enable unidirectional amplification in an erbium-doped fiber amplifier to block noise associated with Rayleigh backscattering. After bidirectional transmission through 500-km LEAF fibers in the recirculating loop, power penalties of less than 2.5 dB were achieved at 10 Gb/s for all channels   \n",

Obviously, the process metric is also one of the key factors that affect the defect-proneness of software modules. In this paper, life-cycle based management process metrics set and history change process metrics set have been proposed based on the characteristics of development process. In order to analyze the importance of these different metrics for predicting defects in aerospace tracking telemetry and control (TT&C) software, an improved PSO optimized support vector machine algorithm (PSO-SVM) has been presented and took into application. The experiment results over the actual TT&C projects suggest that the prediction performance can be significance improved if the 2 kinds of process metrics are included in the model.   \n",

One example is the IBM POWER5TM processor, a two-context simultaneous-multithreaded dual-core chip. In each SMT core, the IBM POWER5 features two levels of thread resource balancing and prioritization. The first level provides automatic in-hardware resource balancing, while the second level is a software-controlled priority mechanism that presents eight levels of thread priorities. Currently, software-controlled prioritization is only used in limited number of cases in the software platforms due to lack of performance characterization of the effects of this mechanism. In this work, we characterize the effects of the software-based prioritization on several different workloads. We show that the impact of the prioritization significantly depends on the workloads coscheduled on a core. By prioritizing the right task, it is possible to obtain more than two times of throughput improvement for synthetic workloads compared to the baseline. We also present two application case studies targeting two different performance metrics: the first case study improves overall throughput by 23.7% and the second case study reduces the total execution time by 9.3%. In addition, we show the circumstances when a background thread can be run transparently without affecting the performance of the foreground thread.   \n",

The receiver provides the following functions: quantization (to eliminate multiple access interference), clock and data recovery, return-to-zero to nonreturn-to-zero conversion (for optical code-division multiple-access compatibility with digital logic), framing (for byte synchronization), and forward-error correction (FEC) using a (255, 239) Reed-Solomon decoder. The receiver more than doubles the number of supported users at a bit-error rate <10\\n-10\\n. The receiver supports an information rate of 156.25 Mb/s. We performed the measurements at a bit rate of 167.4 Mb/s and a chip rate of 1.339 Gb/s (eight chips per bit) to account for FEC overhead   \n",
