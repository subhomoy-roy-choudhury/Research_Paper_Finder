The flexible microactuator is made of a bimorph piezoelectric high-polymer material (poly vinylidene fluoride). The bimorph piezoelectric microactuator consists of two PVDF films cemented with a metal shim in proper polarity. When a voltage is applied across the elements, the upper layer elongates, while the lower contracts producing a deflection. The control scheme consists of a feedforward neural network controller and a fixed-gain PID controller. This neural network controller is trained so as to make the output of the PID controller zero. In the process, the neural network learns the inverse dynamics of the system. The feedback-error-learning controller is implemented using a digital signal processor, and experimental results are given.",

In this paper, an enhanced multi-resolution hierarchical codebook design is proposed to realize precise AoD/AoA estimation. First, the necessary number of sampling angles for generating the codebook is given. Then, the algorithm of iterative adjustment (IA) is developed to improve the codebook design. Simulation results show that using the proposed codebook design, the beams can precisely divide the AoA/AoD intervals as the requirements of the adaptive CS based algorithm.

The pulse based compensator is less hardware and software intensive than other dead time compensation methods providing a low cost solution. The pulse based technique is developed by analyzing the effects of dead time on a pulse by pulse basis and correcting each pulse accordingly. The technique is evaluated through simulation and experimental results. Other compensation methods are evaluated and the results compared with the pulse based technique. This comparison indicates previous methods can produce magnitude and phase errors in the applied terminal voltage, whereas the proposed method compensates for the dead time without significant magnitude and phase errors in the terminal voltage of PWM voltage source inverters.",

As GPU-enabled CNNs move into safety-critical environments, reliability is becoming a growing concern. In this paper, we evaluate and propose strategies to improve the reliability of object detection algorithms, as run on three NVIDIA GPU architectures. We consider three algorithms: 1) you only look once; 2) a faster region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN); and 3) a residual network, exposing live hardware to neutron beams. We complement our beam experiments with fault injection to better characterize fault propagation in CNNs. We show that a single fault occurring in a GPU tends to propagate to multiple active threads, significantly reducing the reliability of a CNN. Moreover, relying on error correcting codes dramatically reduces the number of silent data corruptions (SDCs), but does not reduce the number of critical errors (i.e., errors that could potentially impact safety-critical applications). Based on observations on how faults propagate on GPU architectures, we propose effective strategies to improve CNN reliability. We also consider the benefits of using an algorithm-based fault-tolerance technique for matrix multiplication, which can correct more than 87% of the critical SDCs in a CNN, while redesigning maxpool layers of the CNN to detect up to 98% of critical SDCs.",

The GP-WADV method aims to find the point closest to the obstacle on the link of the manipulator and attach the additional deviation velocity with weighting factors to the point on the basis of the gradient projection method. Utilizing multi-solution characteristics of redundant robots, obstacle avoidance control parameters related to the distance between obstacles and links are proposed according to the gradient projection method for solving inverse kinematic solution. Moreover, a weighted method is adopted to adjust the weighting factors of the primary motion velocity and the additional motion velocity when the link approaches the obstacle, so as to obtain the joint angle solutions more quickly and accurately. The GP-WADV method can ensure that the manipulator can avoid obstacles smoothly without turbulence and solve the highly nonlinear relationship between the position of the manipulator and the joint coordinate, which has the advantages of small amount of calculation, more flexible and convenient real-time control. The advantages of the proposed GP-WADV method are proved by simulation and experiments.",

They use typed defect data from three different software projects to validate the model. They find that the defect detection rates are not equal for defects of different types within the project.

All the films found to be fully amorphous in structure were continuous with uniform thickness and surface morphology. Their optical transmittance in the range 50%-85% was found to be film thickness dependent over the entire visible regime. The Verdet constant (V) and Faraday rotation angle (θ\nf\n ) for different films (~4-18 nm) investigated as a function of wavelength (λ) show considerably higher values for the films of Fe-B-Nb-Y alloy as compared with those for Fe-B-Nb films, e.g., the ~4 nm film of Fe-B-Nb-Y alloy exhibits V ~ 49°/Oe cm and θ\nf\n ~ 26°/μm while it decreased to ~29.4°/Oe and ~11.8°/μm, respectively, for the Fe-B-Nb alloy at λ = 611 nm. A linear relationship is found for the wavelength dependence of V and θ\nf\n for both alloy systems. To the best of our knowledge, these values are considerably higher than those reported for any other magneto-optic material. The films are found to be soft magnetic with a high saturation moment while their magnetic coercivity values increases with thinness of the films.

When illuminated with a photon wavelength of 1.55 mum , a Ge phototransistor shows a large responsivity of ~ 2.0 A/W for a low operating bias \nVA\n of 1.0 V. Optical measurement results further show that good photoresponse could be achieved for a spectral range of 1.31-1.62 mum, making such a device a very promising option for optical detections in the near-infrared (including \nL\n -band) wavelength regime.",

  "abstract": "High quality view synthesis is a prerequisite for future free-viewpoint television. It will enable viewers to move freely in a dynamic real world scene. Depth image based rendering algorithms will play a pivotal role when synthesizing an arbitrary number of novel views by using a subset of captured views and corresponding depth maps only. Usually, each depth map is estimated individually by stereo-matching algorithms and, hence, shows lack of inter-view consistency. This inconsistency affects the quality of view synthesis negatively. This paper enhances the inter-view consistency of multiview depth imagery. First, our approach classifies the color information in the multiview color imagery by modeling color with a mixture of Dirichlet distributions where the model parameters are estimated in a Bayesian framework with variational inference. Second, using the resulting color clusters, we classify the corresponding depth values in the multiview depth imagery. Each clustered depth image is subject to further sub-clustering. Finally, the resulting mean of each sub-cluster is used to enhance the depth imagery at multiple viewpoints. Experiments show that our approach improves the average quality of virtual views by up to 0.8 dB when compared to views synthesized by using conventionally estimated depth maps.",

For those variables sharing the same biological phenomenon, it selected whole groups into the model automatically once one variable among them was selected.

  "abstract": "Using muons in high energy colliders has an advantage in that the muons emit negligible synchrotron radiation, but has the disadvantage that the lifetime of the muons is very short. The latter requires that the muons be accelerated as rapidly as possible to prevent particle loss. The former allows one to loop back and pass through the same linac multiple times, thereby achieving potentially significant cost advantages. Some of the acceleration systems will use recirculating linacs to achieve the reuse of the accelerating structures. However, the large longitudinal beam emittances make it difficult to simultaneously achieve large gradients by using high frequency RF and design an arc with a sufficient energy acceptance. The current state of the design for the acceleration stages for a muon collider is presented, with emphasis on systems accelerating to 70 GeV per beam. Known difficulties will be described as will their possible solutions. In particular, the use of an FFAG-like lattice for the arcs of a recirculating linac is described which accepts a beam with a very large energy spread over a wide range of energies, allowing a single are to be used instead of multiple arcs.",

Stopband attenuation of filters is from 32 db to 63 db with the gap about 3 db. With same performances of stopband attenuation and transition width both the order and passband ripple of filters using the new method is little better than that using Kaiser window if passband attenuation is smaller than 50 db and little worse if bigger than 52 db.

This paper describes a new method of quantization for improving the speech quality. The improvement is obtained by center clipping the prediction residual and by fine quantization of the high-amplitude portions of the prediction residual. The threshold of center clipping is adjusted to provide encoding of the prediction residual at a specified bit rate. This method of quantization not only improves the speech quality by accurate quantization of the prediction residual when its amplitude is large but also allows encoding of the prediction residual at bit rates below 1 bit/sample.",

The thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures obtained by a Fabry-Perot interferometer at Kototabang and the altitudes of F-layer (h'F) observed with ionosondes at Kototabang, Chiang Mai, and Chumphon were also examined. We found that the 3-m scale post-midnight FAIs occurred within plasma bubbles. The convergence of the equatorward neutral winds happened in this particular event related to midnight temperature maximum (MTM) and that the equatorward winds in both northern and southern hemispheres could be responsible for the growth of plasma bubbles around midnight. The uplift of F-layer at low latitudes could increase the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

The main thread doesn't squash instructions after the excepting instruction, conserving fetch bandwidth and allowing execution of instructions independent of the exception. This leads to earlier branch resolution in the post exception code and additional memory latency tolerance. As a proof of concept, using threads to handle software TLB misses is shown to provide performance approaching that of an aggressive hardware TLB miss handler.",

Filament generation and their lengths are controlled by current pulses through the element. A general in-package trim technique was developed using the trimistor and a high-voltage high-current diode, allowing the package pins to be multifunctional. This combination permits the input offset voltage for each channel of a quad op amp to be trimmed in the package to 10 /spl mu/V. The differential input stage utilizes JFET followers, which allows the separation of JFET/bipolar biasing currents. This results in a low offset voltage temperature coefficient (1/spl sigma/) of 2.5 /spl mu/V//spl deg/C. The gain-bandwidth product is enhanced over the unity-gain frequency by using a dual-doublet frequency-compensation technique. One doublet is defined using the JFET follower with feedforward capacitance, and the second doublet is formed by local positive AC feedback applied to the input current mirror. The amplifier is unity-gain stable, with a 100 MHz gain-bandwidth product (at 100 kHz) and 25 V//spl mu/S slew rate.

This paper describes the mutual guarantee bond which can be a viable solution to the problem of access to credit from capital market for small and middle-entrepreneurs. This work uses a jump diffusion process to estimate the price of mutual guarantee bonds made under the terms of the China Small Business Financing Program. First, a logistic structural model of mutual guarantee bond is built up. The model was then employed to design the logical pricing model of credit spread when an exogenous default process jumps for the first time. A geometrical attenuation function is introduced to reflect the unexpected default of intensities. Furthermore, the pricing model of collective small-medium corporate bonds as the spot interest rate is assumed to follow Vasicek model. Finally, the work tests the pricing model with one thousand times Monte Carlo methods and offer theoretical background and empirical evidence for further financial innovation as well.",

The parameters of the linear and nonlinear blocks of the Hammerstein predistorter are estimated simultaneously using the Nonlinear Filtered-x Prediction Error Method (NFxPeM) algorithm. The NFxPEM algorithm has much higher convergence speed than the Nonlinear Filtered-x Least Mean Squares (NFxLMS) algorithm. In the NFxPEM algorithm, the nonlinear system is assumed to be known or accurately identified. In this paper, the NFxPEM with Initial Subsystem Estimates (NFxPEM-ISE) algorithm is developed to avoid accurate identification of the nonlinear system.

However, many AI-enabled Internet-of-Things (AIoT) systems are vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. Therefore, designing robust deep learning models that can be deployed on resource-constrained devices has become an important research topic in the field of 6G-enabled AIoT. In this article, we propose a method for automatically searching for robust and efficient neural network structures for AIoT systems. By introducing a skip connection structure, a feature map with reduced front-end influence can be used for calculations during the classification process. Additionally, a novel type of densely connected search space is proposed. By relaxing this space, it is possible to search for network structures efficiently. In addition, combined with adversarial training and model delay constraints, we propose a multiobjective gradient optimization method to realize the automatic searching of network structures. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective for AIoT systems and superior to state-of-the-art neural architecture search algorithms.",

Over the years, various deficiencies have been identified. In this paper, we focus on the implicit RTO offset problem, where the exact timeout limit of each packet is stretched by restarting the timer using the current timer value on the arrival of each acknowledgement (that acknowledges some new data). It would result in a slow timeout detection which unavoidably degrades the TCP throughput. In this paper, we first present a review of the TCP-RFC with special focus on the implicit RTO offset problem. Based on the insights obtained, we propose an enhanced RTO timer implementation, called E-RTO, for TCP. The implicit RTO offset is removed by mimicking the operation of a multi-timer implementation using a single timer. We then compare our E-RTO with TCP-RTO by simulations. We show that the faster timeout detection of our E-RTO leads to a throughput improvement of up to 3%.",

Currently, methods exist for tracking rolling leukocytes in vivo which rely on manual detection of the cells. In this paper, a new technique inspired by the teardrop shape of the rolling leukocytes is presented for accurately detecting rolling leukocytes. It is based on a feature score, the gradient inverse coefficient of variation (GICOV), which serves to discriminate rolling leukocytes from a cluttered environment. The leukocyte detection process consists of three sequential steps: The first step utilizes a novel teardrop shape matching algorithm to coarsely identify the leukocytes by finding the leukocytes resembling teardrops with a locally maximal GICOV. Second and third steps involve evolution of B-spline snake starting from each of the teardrops found in the first step to refine the leukocytes boundaries and associated GICOV score, and retaining contours with high GICOV scores. The detection process is observed to yield superior results compared to other methods currently in use. The deformation information inherent in the teardrop shapes gives valuable information about the extent to which the cells are adhering to the endothelium.",

  "abstract": "Lesion segmentation is an essential aspect while diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) at initial stages. Manual identification becomes exceptionally challenging and time consuming because of the distinction in morphologies and size of lesions. Manual annotation of lesions by professionals is labor intensive and therefore requires the development of automatic segmentation techniques, but still it is also a challenging task because of the low local contrast and small size lesions present in the image. The automatic segmentation of retinal lesions through deep learning approach is of great impact for the initial diagnosis and treatment of DR. This paper proposes a patch based approach using encoder-decoder neural network to perform retinal lesions segmentation in fundus images. The architecture is trained and validated on IDRiD dataset which consists of microaneurysms, hemorrhages and hard exudate segmentations. In this approach for creating image patches a sliding widow technique is used, later the network evaluates the patches of the images and produces a probability map that predicts different types of lesions. An elaborative experiment was accompanied on IDRiD to calculate the performance of the suggested approach. The projected sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 97.24%, 99.97%, and 99.97% respectively, which validates the effectiveness and dominance of this technique. When compared with other studies on similar tasks, the results obtained by this work indicate substantially improved performance in terms of sensitivity & specificity.",

The angular two‐point correlation function is calculated for 11 samples with flux limits of S\n3.6\n≥ 4–400 μJy, over an 8 deg\n2\n field. The angular clustering strength is measured at >5σ significance at all flux limits, with amplitudes of A= (0.49–29) × 10\n−3\n at 1°, for a power‐law model, Aθ\n−0.8\n. We estimate the redshift distributions of the samples using phenomological models, simulations and photometric redshifts, and so derive the spatial correlation lengths. We compare our results with the Galaxies In Cosmological Simulations (GalICS) models of galaxy evolution and with parametrized models of clustering evolution. The GalICS simulations are consistent with our angular correlation functions, but fail to match the spatial clustering inferred from the phenomological models or the photometric redshifts. We find that the uncertainties in the redshift distributions of our samples dominate the statistical errors in our estimates of the spatial clustering. At low redshifts (median z≤ 0.5), the comoving correlation length is approximately constant, r\n0\n= 6.1 ± 0.5 h\n−1\n Mpc, and then decreases with increasing redshift to a value of 2.9 ± 0.3 h\n−1\n Mpc for the faintest sample, for which the median redshift is z∼ 1. We suggest that this trend can be attributed to a decrease in the average galaxy and halo mass in the fainter flux‐limited samples, corresponding to changes in the relative numbers of early‐ and late‐type galaxies. However, we cannot rule out strong evolution of the correlation length over 0.5 < z < 1.",

  "abstract": "Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the key to natural language processing for the extraction of useful information from the text documents of numerous sources. Several different techniques, i.e., simple rule-based to lexicon-based and more sophisticated machine learning algorithms, have been widely used with different classifiers to get the factual analysis of sentiment. However, lexicon-based sentiment classification is still suffering from low accuracies, mainly due to the deficiency of domain-oriented competitive dictionaries. Similarly, machine learning-based sentiment is also tackling the accuracy constraints because of feature ambiguity from social data. One of the best ways to deal with the accuracy issue is to select the best feature-set and reduce the volume of the feature. This paper proposes a method (namely, GAWA) for feature selection by utilizing the Wrapper Approaches (WA) to select the premier features and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reduce the size of the premier features. The novelty of this work is the modified fitness function of heuristic GA to compute the optimal features by reducing the redundancy for better accuracy. This work aims to present a comprehensive model of hybrid sentiment by using the proposed method, GAWA. It will be valued in developing a new approach for the selection of feature-set with a better accuracy level. The experiments revealed that these techniques could reduce the feature-set up-to 61.95% without negotiating the accuracy level. The new optimal feature sets enhanced the efficiency of the Naïve Bayes algorithm up to 92%. This work is compared with the conventional method of feature selection and concluded the 11% better accuracy than PCA and 8% better than PSO. Furthermore, the results are compared with the literature work and found that the proposed method outperformed the previous research.",

  "abstract": "In a smart building environment nomadic users can benefit from specialised context-sensitive services. These can increase productivity and offer an improved lifestyle for users. The data management system-context architecture (DMS-CA) has been designed to provide these services. The DMS-CA is novel in providing a completely generic system that is both user-friendly and efficient. The system is generic in that it can be tailored by the system administrator (using XML specifications) for a particular environment of context information inputs and a set of services. In addition, the actual rules that determine which services are triggered by which combination of contextual inputs are determined by the individual user in a user-friendly manner. Thus the generic architecture can be easily deployed for a particular building and an individual user. Generic solutions are sometimes inefficient but this system has been designed to be highly efficient through using an event-based architecture and dealing with time in a special way. The DMS-CA has been deployed for a building incorporating a wireless sensor network, and shown to provide a high quality, efficient context-sensitive data delivery service.",

It has been known that the secrecy capacity of such a channel does not increase with signal-to-noise ratio when the transmitter has no channel state information (CSI) under mild conditions. Motivated by Jafar's robust interference alignment technique, we study the so-called staggered multi-antenna block-fading wiretap channel where the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper have different temporal correlation structures. Assuming no CSI at transmitter, we characterize lower and upper bounds on the secrecy degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) of the channel at hand. Our results show that a positive s.d.o.f. can be ensured whenever two receivers experience different fading variation. Remarkably, very simple linear precoding schemes provide the optimal s.d.o.f. in some cases of interest.",

When the affected area includes only portions of one or more cells, there could be a high proportion of False Positives (people who should not have been notified get the message on their cell phones) and/or False Negatives (people who should have been notified but are not notified). We propose a scheme that uses the mobile devices' knowledge of their own location and the target area described in the cell broadcast message to filter the messages in the cell phone and notify the user only when the mobile device's estimated location is within the target area. We evaluate the new scheme in terms of false negatives and positives, radio resource requirements, and notification latency, and compare it with various other geotargeting schemes. We also discuss mechanisms to communicate the target area information efficiently in the limited bandwidth available in cellular broadcast channel.

Ordinal measures, which are based on relative ordering of intensity values in windows, have demonstrable robustness to depth discontinuities, occlusion and noise. The relative ordering of intensity values in each window is represented by a rank permutation which is obtained by sorting the corresponding intensity data. By using a novel distance metric between the rank permutations, we arrive at ordinal correlation coefficients. These coefficients are independent of absolute intensity scale, i.e. they are normalized measures. Further, since rank permutations are invariant to monotone transformations of the intensity values, the coefficients are unaffected by nonlinear effects like gamma variation between images. We have developed a simple algorithm for their efficient implementation. Experiments suggest the superiority of ordinal measures over existing techniques under non-ideal conditions. Though we present ordinal measures in the context of stereo, they serve as a general tool for image matching that is applicable to other vision problems such as motion estimation and image registration.",

Both the proposed machines are optimized for maximum thrust force, and their electromagnetic performance has been compared. It is found that the PS-IPM tubular machine has higher thrust force capability and better magnet utilization compared with the PS-SPM tubular machine. However, due to lower cogging force, the PS-SPM tubular machine has fewer thrust force ripples. Furthermore, the effect of the cross-coupling magnetic saturation on PM flux linkage, and the d-axis and q-axis inductances for both the proposed machines is investigated. It is demonstrated that the PM flux linkage and the d-axis and q-axis inductances are affected by the cross-coupling magnetic saturation.

Specifically, in OFDM-OQAM a frequency selective channel is divided into many smaller but still frequency selective overlapping channels, so approximating the frequency response of a subchannel by the channel frequency response sampled at the subcarrier frequency may be inadequate. Channel effects may be better characterized if the frequency response of each subchannel is represented as a Taylor expansion at the subcarrier frequency.

Furthermore, the number of views of the lectures in relation to the time left until the final exam was checked in order to investigate the students' studying habits. Unsurprisingly, the most noticeable effect here is the last minute cramming. Nevertheless, the overall results show the pros and cons of online education, as well as the huge potential that online education has, even when performed at the current state.",

We design a distributed average consensus algorithm for estimating the unknown object class by computing the value of the smoothness objective function for different class hypotheses. It initially estimates the objective function locally based on the observation of each sensor. As the distributed consensus algorithm progresses, all observations are gradually taken into account in the estimation of the objective function. We illustrate the performance of the distributed classification algorithm for multiview face recognition in an ad hoc network of vision sensors.

Driver speed control is a complex behavior of longitudinal vehicle control consisting of speed perception, decision making, motor control, vehicle dynamics modeling, and individual driver differences. However, there are few existing models that can integrate all of these aspects in a cohesive manner. To address this problem, this paper introduces a mathematical model for a driver's speed control with analytical solutions based on human cognitive mechanisms in driving. This model includes an integrated queuing network-model human processor structure and the rule-based decision field theory. This new model consequently can predict several aspects of driver speed control behavior at the same time, such as driving speed, throttle/brake pedal angle, acceleration, and the frequency of speedometer inspection. A laboratory session involving a driving simulator is conducted to validate the current model. The model accounted for over 99% of the experimental speed of the average driver, and over 95% of the experimental speed for the majority of individual drivers.",

  "abstract": "Axisymmetric models of the Milky Way exhibit strong interrelations between the Galactic constants [the Sun's distance to the Galactic Centre (R\n0\n), and the local rotation speed (θ\n0\n)], the local stellar column density [Σ∗(R\n0\n)] and the shortest-to-longest axis ratio of the dark matter halo (q). In this paper we present simple analytical approximations that allow for an efficient search through the vastness of parameter space, and apply this approximation to investigate the consequences of the uncertain gaseous velocity dispersion (σ\ng\n) on the constraints imposed by the thickness of the Milky Way's gas layer. The extra degree of freedom does not significantly alter the conclusions drawn in a previous paper on the shape of the Milky Way's dark matter halo. A significant contribution to the total gas pressure by cosmic rays and magnetic fields beyond the optical disc is thus ruled out. We find that the Milky Way's dark halo is close to spherical if R\n0\n≳7.1 kpc, while a significantly flattened dark matter halo is possible only if our distance to the Galactic Centre is smaller than ∼6.8 kpc.Thus, if R\n0\n is larger than ∼7 kpc, or θ\n0\n≳170 km s\n−1\n, we can rule out two dark matter candidates that require a highly flattened dark matter halo: (1) decaying massive neutrinos, and (2) a disc of cold molecular hydrogen.It is possible to construct a self-consistent axisymmetric model of the Galaxy based on the IAU-recommended values for the Galactic constants (R\n0\n=8.5 kpc, θ\n0\n=220 km s\n−1\n) only in the unlikely case that the effective gaseous velocity dispersion is ∼19 per cent larger than observed, and if the local stellar column density is less than about 18 M\n⊙\n pc\n−2\n.

Distance of the node from base station, degree of connectivity of the node and trust level of the node is individually analyzed and is linearly combined with weights associated with each parameter. This gives the overall potential function of a node to become a leader. The number of rounds after which leader selection takes place is also equated. Through simulation the algorithm is compared with traditional energy-distance based method for routing protocols LBEERA, OREC, PEGASIS and SHORT.

Second, it can be proved that ABS strategy is equivalent to optimizing for ranking-aware evaluation metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Furthermore, ABS strategy can be very general and applicable in a lot of pairwise structures of pairwise algorithms.

Adiabatic reversible logic was examined in the 1980s and 1990s but in that era power dissipation was a secondary concern, and the trade-off of reduced computational speed for reduced power was deemed unacceptable. Now, power dissipation and the associated heat are the major obstacles limiting progress in integrated circuits, particularly processors. In modern processors trading performance for reduced power dissipation is already done using techniques such as multi-core and dark silicon, so adiabatic logic may now be an attractive approach. To evaluate the adiabatic approach, this paper uses the figure of merit of the product of switching energy, delay time, and area (EDA). Using this figure of merit, adiabatic logic is shown to be advantageous when additional constraints are considered, such as maximum allowed power density. As a proof of concept circuit, a simplified MIPS microprocessor was designed using adiabatic logic based on split-rail charge recovery logic and Bennett clocking. New design and verification tools were developed using structural Verilog and extensions of ModelSim to provide needed capabilities are not available in commercial packages.

  "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to micro-slip clutch control for driveline shuffle attenuation in vehicles with Automated Manual Transmission system. In particular, we introduce an original MPC formulation that effectively takes into account the performance tradeoff between the clutch slip regulation and the torsional oscillation attenuation. Within this formulation, saturation constraints on the clutch torque input as well as the positiveness of the slipping speed needed to avoid gear engagement during the slip are effectively handled. A linear model of the actuator-driveline system is employed to cast the underlying MPC optimization problem as a quadratic programme that, thanks to the effective actually available solvers, allows a fast online implementation of the controller on real transmission control unit platforms. Extensive simulation results and preliminary experimental vehicle tests are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

A set of new motion vectors is computed from the input stream coded motion vectors, and are mapped to either the hierarchical B-frame or zero-delay referencing structures employed by H.264/SVC. These new motion vectors are further subjected to a 3 pixel refinement. As a result, a significant decrease in computational complexity is achieved, while maintaining a close to optimum compression efficiency.",

We integrated the equipment with electrical measurement systems to count cells and/or microparticles. By using a parallel electric-circuit model (diluted case) or Langmuir isotherm model (saturated case), the particle concentration between two NP electrodes can be analyzed by measuring the capacitance of the total circuit.

  "abstract": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) communications are one of the enabling technologies of 5G and beyond networks. While prior work indicates that mMIMO networks employing time division duplexing have a significant capacity growth potential, deploying mMIMO in frequency division duplexing (FDD) networks remains problematic. The two main difficulties in FDD networks are the scalability of the downlink reference signals and the overhead associated with the required uplink feedback for channel state information (CSI) acquisition. To address these difficulties, most existing methods utilize assumptions on the radio environment such as channel sparsity or angular reciprocity. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative method for a scalable and low-overhead approach to FDD mMIMO under the so-called grid-of-beams architecture. The key idea behind our scheme lies in the exploitation of the near-common signal propagation paths that are often found across several mobile users located in nearby regions, through a coordination mechanism. In doing so, we leverage the recently specified device-to-device communications capability in 5G networks. Specifically, we design beam selection algorithms capable of striking a balance between CSI acquisition overhead and multi-user interference mitigation. The selection exploits statistical information, through so-called covariance shaping. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which prove particularly well-suited to rapidly-varying channels with short coherence time.",

Assuming a time division duplex that may offer channel reciprocity between down- and up-links, a low-complexity channel pre-equalization avoids explicit channel estimation at the BS with a very good performance for low MT velocities. A data-aided adaptive detection at the BS starting directly in a tracking mode thanks to pre-equalization can compensate for the increasing mismatch between channel pre-equalization and actual channel response caused by large velocities all along the uplink frame. Simulation results using a 4G realistic scenario show that the proposed uplink OFCDM system offers a good performance with a high spectral efficiency, as it is able to transmit large data rates with mobility and no need of pilot symbols.",

A proposed socio-ecological energy system (SEES) framework used to characterize the core-level subsystems (resources, users, and governance) in terms of second-level and deeper level variables is motivated by the more general multilevel nested socio-ecological system (SES) framework. Second-level and deeper level variables are introduced as a means of characterizing how sustainable a SEES is likely to be by assessing their characteristics. Given vast spatial and temporal complexities in a typical SEES, it becomes necessary to enhance the physical power network with just-in-time (JIT), just-in-place (JIP), and just-in-context (JIC) functionalities. These, in turn, support sustainable energy services by aligning temporal, spatial, and contextual characteristics of resources and users. We refer to the ICT implementation in support of these functionalities as dynamic monitoring and decision systems (DYMONDS). The tradeoffs between the ability of the SEES to ensure sustainable services and the complexity of the supporting smart grid are discussed for several representative energy system architectures.",

The results show that books recommended by collaborative filtering were least favorably evaluated, followed by those recommended by association rule and Amazon. Collaborative filtering carries the risk of breaching users' privacy and its computational costs are higher compared to those of association rule mining. Therefore, if we recommend books based on library loan records, association rule mining should be adopted instead of collaborative filtering.

Designs in which the diode ohmic anode has an overhanging Schottky extension (composite anode contact) are shown to result in a significantly reduced amount of impact ionization, as compared with a simple ohmic contact design. The EL results are consistent with Monte Carlo simulations, which show a reduced impact ionization in composite anode contact devices due to a reduced electron density beneath the anode Schottky extension that, on the one hand, weakens the Gunn domain electric field and softens its variations near the anode edge, and, on the other hand, reduces the number of electrons capable of generating holes by impact ionization. A comparison between standard and composite anode contact approaches in terms of radio-frequency operation of the devices is made showing oscillations up to 109 GHz with an output power of -5 dBm in devices featuring the composite anode contact and no oscillations from all-ohmic contact devices. The findings reported in this paper may be useful not only for the design and the fabrication of planar Gunn diodes but also for other devices such as high-electron-mobility transistors where impact ionization can result in reliability limitations.",

However, the standard TR-UWB scheme, while often motivated by the simplicity of its receiver, is still dogged by implementation concerns. In particular, the receiver requires an extremely wideband delay element, which is difficult to incorporate into low-power integrated systems. In this paper, a TR scheme is proposed in which the separation between the data and reference signals, rather than being a time delay, is a slow rotation over the symbol interval. This provides a (slightly) frequency-shifted reference that, while orthogonal to the data-bearing pulse, still goes through a nearly equal channel. A detailed analysis of the proposed scheme is provided. Simulation results demonstrate the expected result that frequency shifting of the reference in the proposed manner is not effective for high-data-rate systems that experience appreciable intersymbol interference. However, for the targeted low-to-moderate data-rate applications, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system not only achieves the primary goal of providing a much simpler receiver architecture, but also that it outperforms the standard TR-UWB system",

The active impedance matrix calculation entails a summation of the MoM matrix diagonal and off-diagonal sub-matrices. For arrays containing a large number of elements this summation can lead to matrix fill times similar to that of the global MoM calculation.

However, along the route, the signals experience different physical layer impairments (PLIs), and their quality also worsens. The transmission signal quality is affected by the launch power, which must be high for lesser noise at the receiver, and must also be low, such that the PLIs do not start to distort the signal. Further, higher launch power also disrupts the existing lightpath and its neighbours. We propose a weighted strategy for provisioning PLI-aware (PLI-A) lightpaths in MLR networks. Through the simulations, we compare and demonstrate that the proposed strategy demonstrates better performances than our previously proposed algorithm (i.e. PLI-Average (PLI-A)), and existing approaches.",

Drucker (1993) said that knowledge would be the only competitive resource for companies in the future. This is an era in which knowledge plays a dominant role in our daily business lives. Intellectual capital has gradually taken the place of traditional tangible capital in many business organizations. However, practitioners are often puzzled about where they stand, how well they are doing, and what they should do next. This paper aims to construct a knowledge management maturity model as a means to help answer these and related questions. There are three components in the proposed model: maturity levels, knowledge management processes, and knowledge management capabilities or enabling infrastructures. The maturity levels are based on the capability maturity model (CMM) of SEI. This model divides the knowledge management process into four main sub-processes: knowledge creation, knowledge storage, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application, emphasizing the need for continuous process improvement. Furthermore, knowledge management enablers are integrated into KMMM to describe how it supports the practices at each maturity level. The applicability of this model is evaluated through case studies, which also serve to illustrate how knowledge management practices among organizations are compared, and what maturity paths organizations can follow. Three banks were taken for cases study through in depth interview with their senior managements. By analyzing data gathered through the process described above, the conclusion of this study is induced.",

First, the nodal forces in the cores of reactor due to the electromagetism and magnetostriction are calculated using the flux distribution obtained from magnetic field analysis. To determine the dominant cause of noise, the spatial distributions of displacements generated by both nodal forces are then obtained by static structure analysis and they are compared in detail. Moreover, the actual movements of the cores are calculated by vibration analysis. Finally, the effect of the hardness of the cores on noise generation is calculated and measured.

The quantitative evaluation results demonstrated that the use of either PSD- or CC-based features led to higher classification accuracy than the use of PLV-based features, whereas PSD-based features showed much higher sensitivity to changes in EEG electrode location than CC- or PLV-based features.

A significant circadian variation of both body temperature recordings was observed from which a phase and amplitude was reliably determined. These results indicate that BT can be refined as a non-invasive alternative to CBT measurements in the evaluation of circadian phase in field conditions.",

An interesting type of electromagnetic couplers is represented by hysteresis ones, which guarantee a constant torque from zero to synchronous speed, low torque ripple and a simple mechanical configuration. This paper presents a scalability analysis for hysteresis couplers. After a brief re-call of the performance evaluation method, several design optimizations based on finite element analysis, simplified hysteresis model and stochastic algorithms are carried out in order to analyze the effects of the external radial dimensions in the design of hysteresis couplers and draw general design guidelines.",

  "doi": "10.1109/TPEL.2017.2704620",
  "abstract": "In comparison with silicon IGBT, silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET is expected to reduce the switching loss and the conduction loss and to remove external freewheeling diodes (FWDs). However, its body diode has comparatively high forward voltage; therefore, the diode conduction loss generated during dead time increases. As a result, the loss reduction by the use of the SiC MOSFET can be weakened. This paper proposes a simple dead-time controller integrated in an isolated gate driver in order to reduce the diode conduction loss during the dead time. The proposed method has high speed and high robustness against switching noise by using of a current-sense FET with small parasitic capacitance. As a result, the diode conduction time can be shortened within 0.1 μs. In addition, the proposed dead-time control method can be achieved by existing components, including the current-sense FET, which is currently used for short-circuit current detection in hybrid vehicle applications. The proposed method was applied to a 10 kW boost converter with SiC MOSFET. The experimental results showed 1% higher efficiency of the converter with the proposed dead-time-controlled gate driver compared to that without dead-time control circuit, and the efficiency was the similar level as when a SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) was used as FWDs.",

  "abstract": "Cache plays an important role in multilevel storage system. It can greatly reduce the memory access latency. So the cache hit rate has a significant impact on the performance of the application. Many processors provide cache locking mechanism, which can lock the certain lines in cache. It enables an application to affect the cache replacement decisions under software control. This paper presents a novel method, which uses cache locking mechanism to reduce the run-time of java virtual machine (JVM). JVM often uses just-in-time compiler (JIT) to improve the performance. JIT compiles the method that has been invoked certain times, and then JVM executes the compiled method when invoking this method the next time. This paper analyzes the calling situation of the compiled method in JVM, and then proposes a heuristic approach to lock the compiled method in cache for an appropriate period. It can reduce cache miss rate when JVM executes the compiled method. The algorithm has been implemented in HotSpot based on Loongson-3A. Also, it can be implemented in other run-time systems. Experiment results show that the cache locking heuristic algorithm averagely reduces the cache miss rate by 8.5%, and improves the performance by 4% on the benchmark SPECjvm2008.",

Our model treats the class label as a global description of the image, and treats annotation terms as local descriptions of parts of the image. Its underlying probabilistic assumptions naturally integrate these two sources of information. We derive an approximate inference and estimation algorithms based on variational methods, as well as efficient approximations for classifying and annotating new images. We examine the performance of our model on two real-world image data sets, illustrating that a single model provides competitive annotation performance, and superior classification performance.",

Results: The error rates of the Interactive Double Data Entry verification was 15.17 per 10,000 data items (fields). The error rate of the consistent verification was 1.18 per 10,000 data items (fields). The interactive verification's error rate was significantly higher than the consistent verification (P <; 0.05). Conclusions: The error rates of the consistency check were lower than the interactive verification under the same condition, interactive verification was more suitable for data in large clinical research, limited time and case analyzing required right after verification.

On the one hand, perceptual learning is more and more studied in neurobiology and is now considered as an essential part of any living system. In fact, perceptual learning and cognitive learning are both necessary for learning and often depend on each other. On the other hand, many works in machine learning are concerned with \"abstraction\" in order to reduce the amount of complexity related to some learning tasks. In the abstraction framework, perceptual learning can be seen as a specific process that learns how to transform the data before the traditional learning task itself takes place. In this paper, we argue that biologically inspired perceptual learning mechanisms could be used to build efficient low-level abstraction operators that deal with real-world data. To illustrate this, we present an application where perceptual-learning-inspired metaoperators are used to perform an abstraction on an autonomous robot visual perception. The goal of this work is to enable the robot to learn how to identify objects it encounters in its environment.",

Therefore in this paper, an algorithm is proposed for evaluating the average hop count and illustrates the effect of hop count on path reliability for various scenario metrics such as network size, network coverage area, transmission range of the mobile nodes considering mobility of mobile nodes. The methodology uses Random Way Point Mobility Model to locate the spatial distribution of mobile nodes.

In this paper, phototropism in biology is introduced and “light source” model is established for spectrum sensing in CR networks, and a new spectrum sensing technology is researched based on the phototropism. After comparing the commonness and difference between plant growth and spectrum sensing process, a multi-threshold spectrum sensing algorithm based on the phototropism principle for cognitive radio is proposed.

In the SWIM environment, all the related stakeholders need to efficiently obtain the necessary ATM data with situational awareness from various information domains. However, this is difficult to realize in the current system, as different data are structured based on different data models. In this study, we construct domain ontologies based on flight, aeronautical, and weather information exchange models. Further, we develop a common ontology that uniformly defines the inconsistent representation in terms of the 4D, 3D, and 2D concepts and their inclusion relations and propose an integration method for heterogeneous domain ontologies.

  "abstract": "Control of nonlinear under-actuated systems is an area of ongoing research. In certain applications, under- actuated systems are unavoidable. For instance, a biped can not have an actuator between the foot and the ground. In industrial robots, under-actuation can minimize cost and dead weight. Differential flatness, if applicable, provides a systematic approach to plan and control feasible trajectories for such systems. Recently, the authors have formulated a philosophy to design under-actuated planar manipulators that are differentially flat [1]. The design philosophy has two sufficient conditions: (i) an inertia distribution scheme, and (ii) an actuator and torque spring placement scheme. The philosophy covers a broad range of n-DOF manipulator designs with the degree of under- actuation varying from 1 to n - 1 as opposed to under-actuation by one or two in most of the literature on under-actuated manipulators. This paper presents a 3-DOF planar manipulator designed on the basis of this philosophy and an experimental study of controllers based on its differential flatness property. It is demonstrated experimentally that the differential flatness based controllers are able to track the desired trajectories with small tracking errors even in the presence disturbances like friction, parameter uncertainty etc. It is shown via simulation that the errors observed in the trajectories can be attributed to the friction present at the unactuated joint.",

Unfortunately, they suffer from unfiltered switching noise, also known as ripple, whose amplitude increases for progressively lower self-oscillating frequency.

To remedy this SOPAs' pitfall, this paper presents a method to increase the self-oscillation frequency and reduce frequency modulation for a fixed propagation delay and loop filter. This is achieved using a relay that exhibits a novel kind of hysteresis. For that, the theory of its working principle will be discussed in detail, its transfer characteristic will be defined, and an implementation suitable for VLSI will be proposed.

The evaluation is performed using the last 30% of the images in each category, the classification will be positive if the correct subtype is predicted, if not the classification will be negative, nevertheless the classifier could predict no class based on any existence of the flower, or different flower, in this case if non-class is predicted over a different flower the classification will be positive, if not the classification will be negative. The results obtained in each category are showed in the next list, first is the name of each subtype, followed by the percentage of positive classifications. Gerbera Renato (95%), Gerbera Marinilla (99%), Gerbera Chiper (85%), Gerbera Rio Negro (78%), None/Different (74%).",

In our view, this approach helps little for further advancing the current system as the experimental scenario is not repeatable entirely and makes it difficult to compare new research findings with any existing one. We therefore, present a model inspired by the real world settings for detecting low-lying obstacles, considering few assumptions and constraints. The simulations are also proposed based on the model to generate obstacle data any number of time. Furthermore, to validate our model and simulations, field experiments are conducted, and the results obtained are compared with the simulation result. The evaluation parameter in terms of standard deviation, accuracy, false positive, errors encountered suggest that the proposed model and simulations effectively encapsulates the real-world parameters and thus can be explored and utilized further by the research community.",

  "abstract": "In this manuscript, a novel transmit pre-coding matrix generation method and a linear decoding scheme are proposed for the generalised pre-coding aided spatial modulation (GPSM) system. The GPSM scheme proposed recently is a new multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmission technique, which conveys information by activating a subset of receive antennas with the aid of transmit pre-coding. This scheme seems to be suitable in V2X since the base station only transmits data to certain users/vehicles. The proposed pre-coding matrix is based on the lattice reduction (LR) principle and provides significant performance improvement over the original pre-coding design in GPSM. Furthermore, as the GPSM in large-scale antenna systems, which is a trend in future communication systems, might be too complex to be implemented with the maximum likelihood (ML) detection, a linear decoding method is proposed to reduce the implementation complexity. Our studies show that the performance degradation caused by the linear detector can be compensated by the proposed LR based pre-coding. As a result, the LR based GPSM with linear detection is capable of achieving the comparable performance as that of the original GPSM scheme employing ML detection, while with significantly decreased detection complexity.",

These include a global GEO MSS system, Inmarsat, and domestic GEO MSS systems such as North-American AMSC, Japan's N-Star and the Australian Mobilesat. At present, two types of antennas can be used to access GEO MSS services. They include (1) fixed position antennas, which are used with portable transceivers; and (2) fully mobile antennas such as those installed on a land vehicle. The fixed position antennas are relatively easy to design, as they have to meet a moderate (approximately 7%) operational bandwidth and a medium (about 10 dBi) gain. There are a number of complete portable systems in the commercial market that include both a transceiver and an antenna. One inconvenience of portable systems is that they require the user be stationary with respect to the ground. This inconvenience can be overcome with a mobile antenna system. The design of such a system is more challenging as new features associated with mobility have to be incorporated. This paper presents the development and performance of a circular phased array antenna for land vehicle mobile satellite communications. This antenna is specifically aimed for use with the Australian MSS, Mobilesat. However, it can easily be modified for use with the other L-band GEO MSS systems.",

Potential applications for GSVD-based beamforming can be found in MIMO broadcasting, as well as in MIMO relaying under all amplify-and-forward, decode-and-forward, and code-and-forward relay processing schemes. Several of them are highlighted here. We also present simulation-based performance analysis results to justify the use of GSVD for coordinated beamforming.",

The self-designed single-mode generator is constructed in the form of a matrix of acoustic monopoles and is capable to generate a selected single mode. The scattering matrix formalism is a new approach to analyse the acoustical systems containing one or more duct-like elements (joints) connected by some undefined elements such as, for example, acoustic mufflers of different types and so the formalism is frequently applied to analyse the phenomena of noise reduction in such systems. Experimental derivation of the scattering matrix for a wave composed of N modes demands, in general, excitation of N different sound fields at each side of the two-port first. Finally the matrix composed of the modal pressures measurements obtained for each of the exited fields must be inversed to obtain the scattering matrix. Generating single N modes the matrix of the incoming pressure data is, theoretically, diagonal which makes derivation of the scattering matrix much easier. Generation of independent sound fields in the shape of single modes ensures the matrix to be well conditioned.",

Although NASA's Human-Powered Lunar Rover Design Competition was used as the \"vehicle\" for the course development, the main impetus was to provide a true multidisciplinary design experience for both engineering and nonengineering students. Groups of students from the different majors were formed to design and analyze major components of the Lunar Rover. Teamwork within and between the groups was emphasized since the various components had to be integrated to form the final design. An interesting aspect of the course was to treat the two human drivers as one of the major components. This resulted in a complete engineering analysis of the performance characteristics of the students to determine the best choice of drivers (i.e., \"engines\"). To enhance the multidisciplinary experience, technical assistance and/or financial support was provided by the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Science Department as well as the Geology and Exercise Science Departments. The students completed the design, built the rover, and successfully participated in the NASA sponsored competition. Despite an initial hesitance to work with students outside their major, the class came together as a team.

One example is the IBM POWER5TM processor, a two-context simultaneous-multithreaded dual-core chip. In each SMT core, the IBM POWER5 features two levels of thread resource balancing and prioritization. The first level provides automatic in-hardware resource balancing, while the second level is a software-controlled priority mechanism that presents eight levels of thread priorities. Currently, software-controlled prioritization is only used in limited number of cases in the software platforms due to lack of performance characterization of the effects of this mechanism. In this work, we characterize the effects of the software-based prioritization on several different workloads. We show that the impact of the prioritization significantly depends on the workloads coscheduled on a core. By prioritizing the right task, it is possible to obtain more than two times of throughput improvement for synthetic workloads compared to the baseline. We also present two application case studies targeting two different performance metrics: the first case study improves overall throughput by 23.7% and the second case study reduces the total execution time by 9.3%.

  "abstract": "This paper presents a study about human transfer of learning between isomorphs and on the conditions of rule discovery that could be of help for machine learning. When faced with a new problem, the human learner uses the knowledge s/he already possesses in order to mentally represent and manipulate the objects s/he has to deal within the process of problem solving. We propose that familiar domain knowledge provide concepts as useful biases for discovering general rules when solving isomorphic problems as well as problems which entail a larger problem space. Results of two experiments using isomorphic versions of the ldquorule discoveryrdquo Nim game, and versions that entail a larger problem space, suggest that participants use the even concept in the familiar domain according to external representations that can either predictably favor or impair learning and transfer in a foreseeable way.",

  "abstract": "In October of 2014 a large algal bloom formed off the coast of North Carolina near the Pea Island National Park, turning the waters red. In response to this unusual and potentially toxic bloom, students from the Phytofinders team of First Flight High School (FFHS) in Kill Devil Hills, NC, travelled south to collect water samples. Their goal was to examine and identify the genera or species of the organism(s) populating the spreading bloom. The analysis, reported in this paper, revealed that the bloom and resulting discoloration of the coastal waters were due to Mesodinium rubrum. This ciliate is well known for turning the waters red during mass blooms, but it has no other known harmful effects. While the observations and analysis of the Phytofinders had established that the bloom was unlikely to contain harmful constituents, the release of Barnacle, a protected loggerhead sea turtle that had completed a rehabilitation program at the North Carolina Aquarium, was delayed as a precaution.",

  "abstract": "Characteristics of Mobile ad hoc networks are high mobility and frequent link failures that result in low throughput and high end-to-end delay. Multipath routing is an attractive option to reduce the number of route discoveries due to such broken paths so that alternate paths are available. Existing approaches to multipath routing employs pre-computed routes determined during phase of route discovery. Disadvantage of these solutions, however, is high mobility because lack of maintenance of alternate paths. Hence, precisely when needed, the routes are often broken. Further data traffic distribution is not adaptive defeating the purpose of multipath routing. To overcome theses problems, we present an AODV based adaptive distributed hybrid multipath (ADHM) routing solution. In a reactive path setup phase, between the source and destination of a data session, multiple paths are built. Data are stochastically spread over the different paths, according to their estimated quality. During the course of the session, paths are continuously monitored and improved in a proactive way. Link failures are dealt with locally. Extensive use of periodic update packets is employed which sample full paths between source and destination nodes in a Monte Carlo way. Simulation results show that the proposed solution results in significant performance improvement.",

Using a set of enzymes represented by Hydrolase, Isomerase, Ligase, Lyase, Transferase and Oxidoreductase classes, previously used by Dobson et al., this paper proposes a self-learning process able to predict their classes, based on their primary and secondary structures, through a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and genetic algorithm. An SVM can be characterized as a supervised machine learning algorithm capable of resolving linear and non-linear classification problems. During the learning process, both the training data and the corresponding output are presented to the SVM to allow its parameters to be adjusted. This study utilized genetic algorithms - optimization heuristics often used to estimate parameters - to adjust the main parameters of the classifier such as kernel function type and parameter C, which provides the relationship between the training error and the margin of separation between classes. In this specific prediction problem, the results indicate that the best function is an RBF where width is 6.1 and C is 6.9. Using these parameters, the classifier obtains an average accuracy of 79.74%.",

In order to find out whether the thematic feature distinguish the differences between those essays that were rated as high and those rated as low, or the feature is a valid predictor for AES system, we conduct a correlation analysis on the AES corpus, which consists of 2,000 expert-graded College English Test essays. Based on the statistical analysis, we extract the RB-PRP ratio as the formalized form of the thematic feature. Findings of the study indicate that the thematic feature has a significant positive correlation with the human-assigned essay scores. And the performance results indicate that the thematic feature promotes the performance of the AES baseline system.

  "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3049556",
  "abstract": "Accurate and efficient traffic prediction is the key to the realization of intelligent transportation system (ITS), which helps to alleviate traffic congestion and reduce traffic accidents. Due to the complex dynamic spatial-temporal dependence between traffic networks, traffic prediction is extremely challenging. In previous studies, convolution neural network (CNN) and graph convolution network (GCN) were used to model spatial correlation. However, the non-Euclidean correlation of road network reduces the effect of convolution operator modeling. In addition, only considering the traffic interaction around the concerned points simplifies the influence of traffic network. In order to address the above problems, this article proposes an end-to-end global spatial-temporal graph attention network (GST-GAT), which uses the “global interaction + node query” to model the dynamic spatial-temporal correlation of traffic. In the encoder, the long short-term memory (LSTM) component flexibly transforms the traffic dynamic spatial-temporal graph into feedforward differentiable features. Global traffic interaction is proposed to summarize traffic network context changes and integrate all node features at each moment through a forward calculation. Then, each node computes the influence of traffic global interaction on a single node in parallel, and the spatial-temporal interaction information is adaptive fused by gating fusion mechanism. Finally, the end-to-end network structure is used to train the rich mixed feature coding to generate the traffic prediction status of each node. Experiments on public transportation data sets show that GST-GAT performs better than previous work in terms of accuracy and inference speed.",

Experiments on a cluster server indicate the proposed mechanisms improve serverpsilas responsiveness under high load condition by substantially cutting the response time by 7~22% and event drop rate to 10~21%.

  "abstract": "We previously developed a method for high frame rate echocardiography [frame rate (FR) > 300 Hz] using a transmit beam, which was spherically diverging from a virtual point source behind the array. Although such diverging beam illuminates a wider area compared with a focused beam or plane wave, sound pressure starts to decrease just after emission. Another type of a diverging beam, which is diverging from a focal point of a conventional focused beam, has already been proposed for synthetic aperture imaging. This type of beam can increase sound pressure around the focal point, and it would be useful for applications which require higher sound pressure, such as blood flow imaging. In the present study, the feasibility of high frame rate echocardiography using diverging beams from conventional focused beams was examined. In the present study, multiple focused receiving beams were created using diverging beams in front of focal points of conventional focused transmit beams. Smaller focal distance achieves a wider diverging angle and the number of transmissions can be reduced. In the proposed method, wave fronts were assumed to be spherical, and dynamic focusing was used in receive. Since multiple receiving beams were created for each transmission, overlapping receiving beams were averaged after beamforming. The proposed method was evaluated using an ultrasound imaging phantom. Spatial resolutions (width at half maximum) of parallel beamforming with plane wave and diverging beams from virtual point sources at distances of 100 mm behind array and 20 mm in front of array were 1.17, 1.04, and 1.08 mm (at 44 mm depth), respectively. B-mode images could be obtained with good spatial resolutions using transmit beams diverging in front of focal points.",

  "abstract": "Thanks to channel reciprocity, the time-division duplexing operation is typically used for distributed large-scale multiple-input multiple-output systems. With the knowledge of uplink channel state, APs (Access Points) perform the downlink precoding to cooperatively communicate with multiple UEs (User Equipments). Unfortunately, the channel reciprocity is often jeopardized by the non-symmetric transceiver RF (Radio Frequency) circuits at both sides of the link. By excluding UEs from the calibration procedure, the TLS (Total Least Squares) method is extended to the case of partial calibration, where only the APs are involved to exchange calibration signals to compensate for RF mismatches. Nevertheless, channel fluctuations between APs significantly degrade system performance. Therefore, we propose a scheme to obtain the diversity gain, by performing a calibration with the combination of the calibration signals of different channel coherent times. Simulation results confirm the effective performance and robustness of our scheme.",

Geometrical analysis is included to create balanced line voltages from unbalanced pole voltages due to bypass of faulty cells. The space vector diagram of unbalanced pole voltages becomes an irregular six sided polygon and depending on the number of cells faulty, the space vector diagram alters its shape. Sine-triangle based implementation of the space vector diagram is used to derive a general expression for common mode voltage. The modulation index is maximized by addition of common mode voltage. The biggest circle inscribed the irregular six sided polygon gives an expression for the maximum modulation index.

In this paper, we demonstrate how AVL data can be used to characterize the performance of an arterial. Two sources of ITS data were used to assess arterial performance on one corridor in Portland, Oregon. First, we extracted data from the bus dispatch system (BDS) of the transit provider for Portland, Oregon. Performance characteristics as described by bus travel on the arterial were then compared with ground truth data collected by probe vehicles equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) sensors traveling with normal traffic on the same arterial on the same days. Comparisons were made between the two methods and conclusions were drawn regarding the utility of the transit AVL data for real-time advanced traffic management and traveler information systems.",

Firstly, dependences of threshold voltage and field effect mobility on channel length are examined. With decreasing channel length, the threshold voltage shifts to the negative direction which may attribute to carrier diffusion from source/drain to the intrinsic device channel. In addition, significant degradation of field effect mobility is observed in short channel device which are induced by the presence of series contact resistance. The value of contact resistance has also been extracted. Secondly, the drain current noise power spectral densities (S\nID\n) are measured at varied effective gate voltages. The measured noises follow a 1/f\nγ\n and y is about -1.1. Moreover, the normalized noises (S\nID\n/I\nds\n) are dependent linearly on the inverse of channel length and the slope is about -0.75. Finally, the dominant mechanism of low frequency noise in ITO-stabilized ZnO thin film transistor are examined. The slope of normalized noise against effective gate voltage are extracted, which are varied from -1.03 to -1.84 with decreasing channel length and thus it indicates that ITO-stabilized ZnO TFTs varied from bulk dominated devices to interface dominated devices. By using of ΔN-Δμ model, the normalized noises are simulated by considering of contact resistance.

This paper establishes new indices that utilize readily available, real sensor information from the production line, such as buffer levels, machine throughput, etc., to find the machine that is the least energy efficient. This is the machine that causes the line to waste the most energy without producing parts. The energy structure of the production line is analyzed to better understand the complex system dynamics and to find the root cause of the energy inefficiencies. A baseline energy consumption is established, which is the least amount of energy that is needed to produce a certain number of parts on the line. Using this knowledge, the new sustainable manufacturing performance indicators are defined to properly monitor the performance of the line. These indices utilize the energy structure to illustrate the static (energy used when there are no downtime events) and dynamic (energy lost due to downtime) portions of the energy consumption. The concepts of the downtime energy bottleneck and the rated power bottleneck are introduced and proven analytically. These methods are verified using simulation studies in Simulink/MATLAB.",

The safe operation of these pumps is important and lots of research efforts have been devoted to avoid the pump failures. Recently, data-driven approaches arise to be a promising option to discover the underlying failure patterns, which would complement the limitations of conventional physical-based approaches susceptible to uncertain filed conditions. However, most recent studies are conducted based on vibration data. This in turn assumes the pump is equipped with prerequired vibration monitoring capability that would be usually expensive and even not feasible. This paper proposes a degradation assessment approach that exploits the multi-sensor process monitoring already exists in the pump system, for instance, flow rate, pressure, electric current, electric voltage. Specifically, the pump conditions are identified via a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm. Then a distance-based degradation index is designed to characterize the degradation evolution. Finally, a state-space based predictive model is developed to achieve the remaining useful life prognostic. The proposed approach is validated by the process monitoring data collected from the centrifugal pumps tested in the laboratory. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to characterize the pump degradation and predict its remaining useful life.",

In the first coding scheme, an image is first scanned in a quadrant-by-quadrant manner and then encoded by using a one-dimensional grammar-based code which has been developed by Yang and Kieffer (2000) and is called the improved sequential algorithm (or simply the YK algorithm). In the second coding scheme, an image is first predicted by using a context template then scanned in a quadrant-by-quadrant manner, and finally encoded by using the YK algorithm. In the third coding scheme, an image is first scanned in a quadrant-by-quadrant manner and then encoded by using a modified YK algorithm, which also includes a 2D arithmetic code as an option to remove local 2D redundancy. Because of the nature of the YK algorithm and the scanning method, all three coding schemes can remove effectively global redundancy existing in images. Indeed, it is proved that all three coding schemes are universal and outperform asymptotically finite 2D block code and any finite context 2D arithmetic code as the image size gets larger and larger. For small images, however, the second coding scheme is slightly more effective in removing local redundancy occurring in images than does the first coding scheme, and the third one is the best among the three. Simulation results on bi-level images confirm our theoretic results: for images of size 512/spl times/512, our results are comparable with those afforded by JBIG1; for some images of size 1024/spl times/1024, our results are better than those afforded by JBIG1.",

  "doi": "10.1109/TVT.2011.2158865",
  "abstract": "In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), the network topology changes frequently and unpredictably due to the arbitrary mobility of nodes. This feature leads to frequent path failures and route reconstructions, which causes an increase in the routing control overhead. Thus, it is imperative to reduce the overhead of route discovery in the design of routing protocols of MANETs. In this paper, we propose an estimated distance (EstD)-based routing protocol (EDRP) to steer a route discovery in the general direction of a destination, which can restrict the propagation range of route request (RREQ) and reduce the routing overhead. In the EDRP, the change regularity of the received signal strength (RSS) is exploited to estimate the geometrical distance between a pair of nodes, which is called the estimated geometrical distance (EGD). Simulation experiments based on a random waypoint (RWP) model show that the EGD can effectively reflect the actual distance when it is less than the expected value of the distance [which is called the estimation radius (E-Radius)] between any node pairs. We also propose an estimated topological distance (ETD), which is a topology-based EstD, as an aid to the EGD, which can mitigate the effect of inaccurate EGD. The EstD is a combination of EGD and ETD. In the protocol, every node evaluates the link quality through the computational process of the EGD to eliminate the weak links and then uses the EstD (EGD and ETD) to steer the RREQ packets toward the general direction of the destination. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol can significantly reduce the routing overhead and improve the routing performance in dense or high-mobility networks.",

  "abstract": "Considering time interval models, which can describe a large class of models including timed event graphs and P-time event graphs, a general aim is to control the system such that it follows a one-periodic behavior starting from an initial state with a minimal or maximal cycle time. The aim of this article is the optimization of the time durations in order to achieve a given rate of production when the quantity of resources (number of pallets, machines, and so on), usually represented by the initial marking, is assumed to be a fixed datum. A prior step is the determination of the critical subsystems, whose variations can influence these optimal values and affect the obtainment of the relevant trajectories and the noncritical subsystems leading to time margins. Two approaches are proposed in that aim. A first technique is based on an adaptation of the classical Martínez and Silva's algorithm, where each solution gives a critical subsystem, while a second approach checks each inequality of the system by an optimality verification. Using this partition of the subsystems and particularly exploiting the time margins corresponding to idle times of machines, the approach allows an optimization of the noncritical time durations when the extremum cycle times and the resources are the constant parameters of the problem. In this article, the definition of P-time event graphs is generalized by introducing the model of time supervisor place, which restricts the time behavior of a set of places. The approach is applied to a plant bakery composed of two production lines.",

  "abstract": "EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution) is a set of improvements to the GSM, aiming at providing higher data rate transmission per radio timeslot and increasing spectral efficiency. Such high data rates put new requirements on the receiver design. On the other hand, the receiver design needs to be efficient from a cost, size and power consumption point of view in order to allow high volume production. A receiver architecture that fulfills such mobile terminal requirements is e.g. the direct conversion receiver. Such a receiver, however, suffers from some problems. One of the problems is that the DC offset can not be eliminated completely in the RF part of the receiver and has to be taken care of in the baseband signal processing. Lindoff (2000) proposed to use a least square (LS) algorithm to jointly estimate the channel parameters and the DC offset by a standard correlation algorithm for synchronization. In an environment which generates a high delay spread to the signal, this algorithm can be applied directly only with very high computational complexity, for the LS estimation has to be repeated several times. In order to reduce the complexity we propose to introduce a fine-synchronization step before the LS estimation. This step, usually used for channel estimation and synchronization in the absence of DC offset, can reduce the computational complexity by a factor 5 or 6.",

  "abstract": "High-frame-rate echocardiography using unfocused transmit beams and parallel receive beamforming is a promising method for evaluation of cardiac function, such as imaging of rapid propagation of the heart wall vibration. In this technique, high temporal resolution is realized at the expense of spatial resolution and contrast. The phase coherence factor has been developed to improve spatial resolution and contrast in ultrasonography. It evaluates the variance in phases of echo signals received by individual transducer elements after delay compensation as in the conventional delay and sum beamforming process. However, the phase coherence factor suppresses speckle echoes because phases of speckle echoes fluctuate due to their mutual interference. In the present study, total receiving aperture was divided into several sub-apertures, and conventional delay and sum beamforming was performed with respect to each sub-aperture to suppress echoes from scatterers except for that from a focal point. After sub-aperture beamforming, the phase coherence factor was obtained from beamformed RF signals from respective sub-apertures. By means of this procedure, undesirable echoes, which can interfere with the echo from a focal point, can be suppressed by sub-aperture beamforming, and the degradation of the phase coherence factor due to phase fluctuation caused by such interference can be avoided. Effects of sub-aperture beamforming were evaluated using a phantom. By sub-aperture beamforming, the average intensity of speckle echoes from a diffuse scattering medium was significantly higher (-39.9 dB) than that obtained without sub-aperture beamforming (-48.7 dB). As for spatial resolution, the width at half maximum of the lateral echo amplitude profile obtained without the phase coherence factor was 1.06 mm. Using the phase coherence factor, spatial resolution was improved significantly, and sub-aperture beamforming achieved a better spatial resolution of 0.75 mm than that of 0.78 mm ob...",

  "abstract": "The problem of communicating a single message to a destination in presence of multiple relay nodes, referred to as cooperative unicast network, is considered. First, we introduce mixed noisy network coding (MNNC) scheme which generalizes noisy network coding where relays are allowed to decode-and-forward (DF) messages while all of them (without exception) transmit noisy descriptions of their observations. These descriptions are exploited at the destination and DF relays aim to decode the transmitted messages while creating full cooperation among the nodes. Moreover, the destination and DF relays can independently select the set of descriptions to be decoded or treated as interference. This concept is further extended to multihopping scenarios, referred to as layered MNNC, where DF relays are organized into disjoint groups representing one hop in the network. For cooperative unicast additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) networks, we show that-provided DF relays are properly chosen-MNNC improves over all previously established constant gaps to the cut-set bound. Second, we consider the composite cooperative unicast network where the channel parameters are randomly drawn before communication starts and remain fixed during the transmission. Each draw is assumed to be unknown at the source and fully known at the destination but only partly known at the relays. We introduce through MNNC scheme the concept of selective coding strategy (SCS) that enables relays to decide dynamically whether, in addition to communicate noisy descriptions, is possible to decode and forward messages. It is demonstrated through slow-fading AWGN relay networks that SCS clearly outperforms conventional coding schemes.",

  "abstract": "A theory of wave propagation through semiconductors, assuming general orientations of the carrier drift velocities, the propagation vector, and the RF electric field relative to an applied steady magnetic field, is derived. This is specialized to obtain a theory of pseudolongitudinal wave interactions in electron and hole streams in InSb in a transverse and in a parallel (or zero) magnetic field. The theory explains the various features of high electric-field microwave emission and RF oscillations observed by experimenters over several years in a wide variety of material conditions and field configurations. Explained in particular are the facts that: 1) starting n- or p-type materials with initial density ≲ 10\n14\ncm\n-3\nhave to be impact ionized to achieve electron or hole number densities adequate for microwave emission; 2) for impact-ionized plasmas, it takes a minimum transverse magnetic field (\nB\\perp\n) on the order of 1.5-2.5 kG for the onset of microwave emission and the threshold current thereafter diminishes monotonically with increasing\nB\\perp\n; 3) p-type material with high enough initial density (n\nh\n≳ 1 - 3 × 10\n15\ncm\n-3\n) is unstable with electron injecting contacts in the presence of 15-20 percent (or more) electron injection; and 4) in the absence of\nB\\perp\n, a longitudinal magnetic field is necessary mainly to prevent pinching of the plasma at the high current densities needed for microwave emission, etc. RF oscillations observed in n- and p-type InSb with or without\nB\\perp\nare also explained. The dependence of the oscillation frequency on the magnitude of\nB\\perp\nshows a remarkable correlation with experimental observations.",

In this waveguide, both the refractive index and cross-sectional dimensions of a core are adiabatically varied along a propagation direction in such a way that the normalized frequency V of the waveguide may be kept constant. Since radiation loss caused by waveguide imperfections is strongly dependent on the V value, the waveguide has good mode-field-converting capability without causing high radiation loss. Layer thickness and index of a core of a silica waveguide were tapered by modulating a raw material gas flow in a flame hydrolysis deposition method, and a channel width taper was formed by a photolithographical technique. In order to confirm the usefulness, taper waveguides have been used (1) to achieve good field matching between a fiber and a guided-wave optical switch, and (2) to fabricate a fiber-compatible monolithic 32*32 star coupler in a small chip.<\n>",

  "abstract": "In this paper, we study and optimize the cooperation cluster size in cooperative spectrum sensing to maximize the throughput of secondary users (SUs). To calculate the effective throughput, we assume each SU spends just 1 symbol to negotiate with the other SUs in its transmission range. This is the minimum overhead required for each SU to broadcast its sensing decision to the other members of the cluster. When the number of SUs is large, the throughput spent for the negotiation is noticeable and therefore increasing the cooperation cluster size does not improve the effective throughput anymore. In this paper, we calculate the effective throughput as a function of the cooperation cluster size, and then we maximize the throughput by finding the optimal cluster size. Various numerical results show that when decisions are combined by the OR-rule, the optimum cooperation cluster size is less than when the AND-rule is used. On the other hand, the optimum cluster size monotonically decreases with the increase in the average SNR of the SUs. Another interesting result is that when the cluster size is optimized the OR-rule always outperforms the AND-rule.",

  "abstract": "Leakage of information through timing side channels is a problem for all sorts of computing machinery, but the impact of such channels is especially dramatic on embedded systems. The reason for this is that these environments allow attackers to exploit small timing differences down to clock cycle accuracy. On the defensive side it is therefore advisable to evaluate cautiously if security-critical code contains data dependent timing discrepancies. When working with real hardware, testing for such vulnerabilities is a tedious process. In order to reduce the burden of vetting, we study approaches that allow cycle-accurate behavioral emulation of relevant CPU behavior such as instruction pipeline flushes and bus contention. We show that our approach is feasible and efficient by implementing an emulator of the popular ARM Cortex-M core. Then we give an overview about the problems of cycle-accurate emulation and demonstrate our approach towards a cycle-accurate ARM Thumb-2 simulator. Finally, we show how this simulator can be integrated into the build process of firmware to check for the presence of timing side channels before the system is deployed.",

  "abstract": "The model of the digitized battlefield utilizes communications networks that automatically execute data transfers between functional areas-combat, combat support and combat service support. With evolving technology and standards, high frequency (HF) radio networking offers one avenue to support tactical and global communications requirements for quick responses to sudden contingencies and for rapid deployments. Standardized ALE procedures, improved signal-processing modems, and interoperable message transfer protocols provide basic elements to create adaptive, automated HF radio networks to support information exchange among Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C4I) systems. Unlike other communications services, however, dynamic ionospheric conditions, heavy utilization and inadvertent jamming make the HF channel a hostile one, where links between nodes are subject to frequent failure. These factors yield significantly degraded performance without adaptive, dynamic management. The occurrence of self-jamming under heavy load conditions adds further complexity to performance analysis and prediction. Assessment of network design relative to optimized performance presents a challenging problem. This paper describes computer simulation predictions which provide a basis for assessment of HF radio networks that operates with the MIL-STD procedures and protocols. The simulation model extends earlier work for MIL-STD-188-141A Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) with an implementation of MIL-STD-187-721 for HF network access. It also implements the message format provisions of MIL-STD-188-220 for the data link protocol to enhance battlefield interoperability and compatibility to support the exchange of digital information. It adds to simulation efforts on HF radio network performance. The purpose of this study is to assess the integration of these MIL-STD protocols and the network performance under heavy message load.

The development of methods to accurately and reproducibly recover useful quantitative information from medical images is often hampered by uncertainties in handling these data related to image acquisition parameters, the variability of normal human anatomy and physiology, the presence of disease or other abnormal conditions, and a variety of other factors. Several image analysis strategies are presented that make use of models based on geometrical and physical/biomechanical information to help constrain the range of possible solutions in the presence of such uncertainty. Included are approaches for image segmentation, object motion tracking, shape/volume measurement, and deformation analysis. These ideas are presented in the context of three problem/application areas within the general field of organ/tissue-level medical image analysis: (i) the characterization of cardiac function from noninvasive 4D image data, (ii) the analysis of neuro-anatomical structure from magnetic resonance images, and (iii) the development of an approach that compensates for brain shift in the image data during image-guided neurosurgery.

The rationale is that some entities contest to gain as much profit as possible in an open environment. We study the sellerspsila side. Sellers involved in a number of games with buyers, are trying to achieve as greater prices as possible in order to gain more profit from each game.

In this paper, we propose MinPeak algorithm to schedule deferrable appliances with the objective of reducing peak load demand. The problem is solved as a strip-packing problem, where all the appliances, characterized by their power consumption and execution time units, are packed or scheduled within a certain scheduling time horizon or width of a strip.

First, the incorporation of nitrogen in high In-content GaInAsN was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, revealing that already a small amount of Ga in the GaInAsN alloy (x>0.92) leads to an almost complete change from pure In-N bonding to nitrogen atoms bonded to at least on Ga-neighbor.

Proof-of-concept results are provided for GSM signals given they are readily available in most areas. Recent RF fingerprinting work has demonstrated average device classification accuracies (serial number identification) of 92% using OFDM-based 802.11a preamble responses at SNR = 6 dB. The goal here was to determine if similar performance could be achieved using RF fingerprints extracted from near-transient and midamble regions of GSM signals. This was done using instantaneous phase responses from each region to form RF statistical fingerprints that are subsequently classified using Fisher-based MDA/ML processing. Considering all GSM device permutations from four different manufacturers, near-transient RF fingerprinting provided nearly 13% improvement in classification performance when compared with midamble RF fingerprinting and achieved average classification performance consistent with the 802.11a benchmark of 92% correct classification at SNR = 6 dB.",

A thorough analysis of code for potentially available parallelism is crucial for choosing between speculative or non-speculative execution. In this paper, we present the outcome of an empirical study on a collection of sequential applications to determine what type of parallelism is available and whether it is beneficial to use TLS.

This paper first introduces and analyzes the basic principle of acoustic source localization using time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements. Time difference measurement is a key problem in TDOA location method for its accuracy directly determines the position estimation accuracy of the location system. Generalized cross-correlation (GCC) method can weaken the impact of noise on the delay estimation accuracy so this method is adopted in the paper to obtain TDOA measurement by detecting the peak position of the correlation function of two signals. Through the analysis of TDOA location algorithm, an improved Taylor algorithm with 10 iterations is proposed to solve the location coordinate of the acoustic source. This algorithm can achieve a higher accuracy with relatively smaller calculation. In order to forecast system performance, MATLAB simulations are realized for an acoustic source localization system using microphone array. Finally, the implementation of location system and actual test results are presented. In the actual environment, positioning errors are within 3 cm with microphone array element spacing of 50 cm and it is shown the implemented system can be applied to acoustic source localization.",

SPS requires only mild assumptions on the measurement noise. This work proposes distributed solutions, based on SPS and suited to a wide variety of sensor networks, for distributed in-node evaluation of nonasymptotic confidence regions as defined by SPS. More specifically, a tagged and aggregated sum information diffusion algorithm is introduced, which exploits the specificities of SPS to avoid flooding the network with all measurements provided by the sensors. The performance of the proposed solutions is evaluated in terms of required traffic load, both analytically and experimentally on different network topologies.

However, it was recently shown that DVFS has direct and adverse effects on system reliability. In this work, we investigate static and dynamic reliability-aware energy management schemes to minimize energy consumption for periodic real-time systems while preserving system reliability. Focusing on earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling, we first show that the static version of the problem is NP-hard and propose two task-level utilization-based heuristics. Then, we develop a job-level online scheme by building on the idea of wrapper-tasks, to monitor and manage dynamic slack efficiently in reliability-aware settings. The feasibility of the dynamic scheme is formally proved. Finally, we present two integrated approaches to reclaim both static and dynamic slack at runtime. To preserve system reliability, the proposed schemes incorporate recovery tasks/jobs into the schedule as needed, while still using the remaining slack for energy savings. The proposed schemes are evaluated through extensive simulations. The results confirm that all the proposed schemes can preserve the system reliability, while the ordinary (but reliability-ignorant) energy management schemes result in drastically decreased system reliability. For the static heuristics, the energy savings are close to what can be achieved by an optimal solution by a margin of 5 percent. By effectively exploiting the runtime slack, the dynamic schemes can achieve additional energy savings while preserving system reliability.",

With the aid of 6 × 6 Luttinger Hamiltonian, we employ the combination of two methods, k·p perturbation and the transfer matrix method, to acquire the electron and hole wave functions numerically. The envelope function approximation was considered to obtain these wave functions for a special basis set. While adjacent valence sub-bands have been determined approximately, the conduction bands are approximated as parabolic. The effect of Stokes shift has also been taken into account. The dipole moment matrix elements for interband atomic transitions are evaluated via the correlation between the electron and hole envelope functions, for both orthogonal polarizations, thus simplifying the calculation of the photoluminescence intensity. Spatial variations in the hole/electron wave functions have been examined with the introduction of piezoelectric and spontaneous polarization internal fields. We theoretically establish the possibility of a highly efficient InGaN red emitter, resulting in a uniform luminescence in red, green, and blue emissions from a white light emitting diode by adjusting the material composition, internal field, and well thickness.",

Its combination with the cloud server can solve big data processing problems to meet users' needs and bring us great convenience. However, there are two challenges we need to face: data sharing and key leakage. To solve the above challenges, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is used to achieve data sharing combined with searchable encryption (SE). Most of the existing attribute-based searchable encryption (SE) schemes are inefficient and not suitable for IoT devices because of the large amount of attributes and keys. The key-leakage problem is serious in practice which very little literature focused on it. In order to address both problems, in this article, we propose a key aggregation searchable encryption (KASE) scheme based on the blockchain with auxiliary input (AI), which is capable of achieving secure data sharing on the encrypted data. Our scheme is presented through a novel chosen plaintext attack (CPA) secure scheme. We prove our scheme is chosen ciphertext attack (CCA) secure against key leakage under the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption and Goldreich-Leivin theorem. Moreover, we adopt the proposed scheme to establish a data-sharing system based on blockchain, which improves search efficiency and connects the global ecology.

  "abstract": "A logic for reasoning about dynamic systems should be defined on three levels. The material level is expressed in quantitative terms, the image level defines models in terms of discrete mathematics, and the logic level defines the logical language and deduction system. Consider the problem of guiding a vehicle that has to move within severe spatial constraints. For a simple version of a cellular ontology, the material level is a 2D surface where vehicles move along trajectories formed from straight-line segments and circular arcs which are each others' tangents at the points of transition. The image level is obtained by dividing the surface into equally-sized cells, which may be, for example, quadratic or hexagonal. For a given cell structure, with a finite set of ports and a finite set of orientations, and allowing also for some restrictions on vehicle movements, we obtain a finite set of possible maneuvers. It is therefore possible to calculate in advance a qualitative information structure that can be used for analyzing and planning the movements of a vehicle in the cellular driving space.",

Not only is the number of archivists limited, the time they can spend on annotating one item is insufficient to create time-based and detailed descriptions about the content to make fully optimized video search possible. Furthermore, we observe an accelerated increase in newly created audiovisual material that must be described due to introduction of file-based production methods. — Fortunately, more and more high-quality feature extraction tools are being developed by research institutes. These tools examine the audiovisual essence and return particular information about the analyzed video and/or audio streams. For example, tools can automatically detect shot boundaries, detect and recognize faces and objects, segment audio streams, etc. As a result, they quickly and cheaply generate metadata that can be used for indexing and searching. On top of that, it relieves archivists of performing tedious and repetitive, but necessary low-added value tasks, for example identifying within an audio stream the speech and music segments. Although most tools are currently not yet commercially offered, it is to be expected that these solutions soon will become available for broadcasters and media companies alike. — In this paper, we describe a solution on how to integrate such feature extraction tools within the annotation workflow of a media company. This solution, in the form of an architecture and workflow, is scalable, extensible, loosely coupled, and has clear and easy to implement interfaces. As such, our architecture allows one to plug in additional tools irrespective of the software and hardware used by the media company. — By integrating feature extraction tools within the workflow of annotating audiovisual essence, more and better metadata can be created allowing other tools to improve indexing, search and retrieval of media material within audiovisual archives.",

To illustrate the benefits of the architecture, four high-bandwidth signal processing applications including an MPEG-2 video encoder and a Doppler radar processor have been mapped to a prototype aSOC device using our design mapping technology. Through experimentation it is shown that aSOC communication outperforms a hierarchical bus-based system-on-chip (SoC) approach by up to a factor of five. A VLSI implementation of the communication architecture indicates clock rates of 400 MHz in 0.18-/spl mu/m technology for sustained on-chip communication.

A novel mode, fly-by trajectory, is firstly proposed for far-range trajectory control corresponding to debris capture by compact with whipple material. Compared with general rendezvous and capture mode, there is no requirement on relative velocity in fly-by mode. At last, hybrid optimization algorithm is applied to far-range trajectory optimization based on multi-revolution Lambert algorithm. Simulations are conducted with three scenarios to illustrate effectiveness of proposed concept.

Through the comprehensive analysis of metallographic structure and microhardness, the temperature distribution of bearing outer ring was obtained. The results showed that the adhesive wear was the main wear type for thrust washer while the fatigue wear was a small part; a great axial force existed in the working mechanism, which lead to big contact stress and speed up wear; the high temperature on the friction surface could reach about 700°C and cause the tempering process in the material; Inadequate cooling effect due to lack of lubrication oil may be another main reason for the high temperature caused by wear.",

In order to get a better strategy for ionospheric scintillation monitoring with GNSS observations, in this article, we studied the capability of ROTI (Rate of TEC Index) from different calculation strategies in reflecting the ionospheric scintillation by comparing their correlation with amplitude scintillation index in low-latitude region of China with the data from CMONOC (Crustal Movement Observation Network of China). The results indicate that various samplings all can show strong consistency with scintillation index S4 in overall and higher samplings is followed with higher correlations with S4. The contribution of calculation time interval of ROTI to the correlation with S4 depends on sampling rate. The analysis also indicates that the curve of ROTI tends to be more smooth as the time interval of calculation of ROTI increases and the ROTI in shorter time interval of calculation, e.g., 1 minute, can reveal more details compared with the curve of scintillation indices. Moreover, the ROTI maps retrieved from CMONOC can reflect the temporal and spatial evolution of ionospheric irregularities in the region of China, which is helpful to provide warning for GNSS users.",

TCP performs poorly on wireless links with bursty losses, when it is forced to rely on limited information available from batched acknowledgements, (i.e., multiple packets are acknowledged with one acknowledgment packet). In this paper, a selective negative acknowledgement (SNACK) mechanism is designed to overcome the limitation of batched acknowledgments. A new link layer retransmission protocol, called, SNACK-NS (new snoop), is proposed. Through the detection and retransmission functions that are provided by the two protocol components of SNACK-NS, namely, SNACK-snoop and SNACK-TCP, the transmission performance of TCP over wireless network is greatly enhanced in both fixed host (FH) to mobile host (MH) and MH to FH transmissions.",

The model of buck converter is approximated by a nonlinear model, and it is further analyzed based on the electricity knowledge. Due to the dynamic characteristics of network transmission, multiplicative noises need to be considered, which are described as a product of some uncorrelated standardized normal distribution and the transmitted signal. Meanwhile, an event-triggered mechanism is utilized for the purpose of reducing the energy consumption, and an FD observer is designed to detect the fault presented in buck converter. Some novel sufficient conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee the robust stability of the FD system, and the H\n∞\n optimal fault tracking performance index is also achieved. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to show the validity and merit of the proposed method.",

In highly-secure programs, the declassification decision must be taken explicitly, which means that data or operations which are being declassified are known. This decision is critical and must be supported by automated verifications, which determine the risk of information leakage related to a given declassification. Currently, the available techniques are based on static analysis, which perform an over-approximation of this risk. In this paper, we study how dynamic approaches can perform more precise analysis on what is declassified and where, and finally ensure the security property, which allows declassification, at runtime. The notion of dynamic analysis w.r.t. to non-leakage properties is studied from a theoretical point of view and this proof of concept is illustrated using a ¿While¿ language.",

Such approximation techniques have been carefully tailored to our problems and their approximation error and complexity are analyzed. Simulation study demonstrates that the proposed approaches perform much better than approaches without considering the localization uncertainty properly. Finally, we have applied the proposed approaches on the experimentally collected real data from a dye concentration field over a section of a river and a temperature field of an outdoor swimming pool to provide proof of concept tests and evaluate the proposed schemes in real situations.

The collaboration defines multinational teams that work on a project for several weeks. The objective of this study is to determine and compare the level of motivation that students report before and after their participation in the collaboration. The level of motivation is based on their self-reported interest and perception of value, two of the constructs collected with a survey based on the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). Collected data is analyzed statistically based on gender and geographic location. The expectation is to have high levels of motivation before and after their participation in the multinational design project, thus implying interest and satisfaction with the activity. Results indicate that students have high level of motivation before participation, independent of the two factors studied. There is a reduction in the level of motivation after participation, with some variations based on gender and location. Discussion of these results is provided.",

The source transmits the message to the destination using hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) with incremental redundancy (IR). The relay overhears the transmitted message, amplifies it using a variable gain amplifier, and then forwards the message to the destination. This latter combines both the source and the relay message and tries to decode the information. In case of decoding failure, the destination sends a negative acknowledgement. A new replica of the message containing new parity bits is then transmitted in the subsequent HARQ round. This process continues until successful decoding occurs at the destination or a maximum number \nM\n of rounds is reached. We study the performance of HARQ-IR over the considered relay channel from an information theoretic perspective. We derive for instance exact expressions and bounds for the information outage probability, the average number of transmissions, and the average transmission rate. The derived exact expressions are validated by Monte Carlo simulations.",

Interestingly, the exponent turns out to be related to the Bhattacharyya distance between the distributions P\nX\n and P\nY\n.

  "abstract": "We have derived the disruption times of star clusters from cluster samples of four galaxies, M51, M33, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the solar neighbourhood. If the disruption time of clusters in a galaxy depends only on their initial mass as t\ndis\n(yr) =t\n4\ndis\n(M\ncl\n/10\n4\n M\n⊙\n)\nγ\n, and if the cluster formation rate is constant, then the mass and age distributions of the observed clusters will each be given by double power-law relations. For clusters of low mass or young age the power law depends on the fading of the clusters below the detection limit due to the evolution of the stars. For clusters of high mass and old age the power law depends on the disruption time of the clusters. The samples of clusters in M51 and M33, observed with HST-WFPC2, indeed show the predicted double power-law relations in both their mass and age distributions. The values of t\ndis\n4\n and γ can be derived from these relations. For the cluster samples of the SMC and the solar neighbourhood, taken from the literature, only the age distribution is known. This also shows the characteristic double power-law behaviour, which allows the determination of t\n4\ndis\n and γ in these galaxies. The values of γ are the same in the four galaxies within the uncertainty, and the mean value is γ= 0.62 ± 0.06. However, the disruption time t\n4\ndis\n of a cluster of 10\n4\n M\n⊙\n is very different in the different galaxies. The clusters in the SMC have the longest disruption time, t\n4\ndis\n≃ 8 × 10\n9\n yr, and the clusters at 1–3 kpc from the nucleus of M51 have the shortest disruption time of t\n4\ndis\n≃ 4 × 10\n7\n yr. The disruption time of clusters 1–5 kpc from the nucleus of M33 is t\n4\ndis\n≃ 1.3 × 10\n8\n yr and for clusters within 1 kpc from the Sun we find t\n4\ndis\n≃ 1.0 × 10\n9\n yr.",

The hardware circuit is responsible for detecting submodule output voltage and its output result is transmitted to a processor to accomplish the final fault diagnosis along with drive signals.

A great deal of research has been done to solve the general problem. Work on topics like multi-databases, mediators and ontologies has been directed at solving the general data integration problem. While all of this activity has been useful, the general problem of integrating heterogeneous data sources remains only partially solved. This paper looks at the solution of a sub-problem of the general problem where the data sources are restricted to relational databases and record-based legacy systems owned by the same organization. For many organizations, this restriction precisely defines their integration problem. For example, data warehouses typically have a tuple as their storage format, whether they are table- or cube-oriented. The task of defining the tuple requires integrating the organization's existing relational and/or record-based legacy systems. Populating the data warehouse can be accomplished by querying the integrated data sources. Specifically, we provide a mechanism for developing a relational model for the set of data sources, provide a method for generating correct queries over the model, and create an architecture for executing the queries based on the mobile agent paradigm. A prototype of the system has been designed and implemented.",

  "doi": "10.1145/3417113.3422154",
  "abstract": "Context: Insecure coding patterns (ICPs), such as hard-coded passwords can be inadvertently introduced in infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts, providing malicious users the opportunity to attack provisioned computing infrastructure. As performing code reviews is resource-intensive, a characterization of co-located ICPs, i.e., ICPs that occur together in a script can help practitioners to prioritize their review efforts and mitigate ICPs in IaC scripts. Objective: The goal of this paper is to help practitioners in prioritizing code review efforts for infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts by conducting an empirical study of co-located insecure coding patterns in IaC scripts. Methodology: We conduct an empirical study with 1613, 2764 and 2845 Puppet scripts respectively collected from three organizations namely, Mozilla, Openstack, and Wikimedia. We apply association rule mining to identify co-located ICPs in IaC scripts. Results: We observe 17.9%, 32.9%, and 26.7% of the scripts to include colocated ICPs respectively, for Mozilla, Openstack, and Wikimedia. The most frequent co-located ICP category is hard-coded secret and suspicious comment. Conclusion: Practitioners can prioritize code review efforts for IaC scripts by reviewing scripts that include co-located ICPs.",

Software development project failures using conventional SDLC are often attributed to project delays, resulting in budget overruns. On the other hand, a well planned and documented systems development project is more likely to result in a system that meets the expectations of both the intended users and the software engineers. This paper takes another look at conventional SDLC methodology by focusing on an aspect that is often overlooked in systems development practice, namely the significance of good documentation.",

The most significant results of the aggregation process are as follows: (I) interviews, preferentially structured, appear to be one of the most effective elicitation techniques; (2) many techniques often cited in the literature, like card sorting, ranking or thinking aloud, tend to be less effective than interviews; (3) analyst experience does not appear to be a relevant factor; and (4) the studies conducted have not found the use of intermediate representations during elicitation to have significant positive effects. It should be noted that, as a general rule, the studies from which these results were aggregated have not been replicated, and therefore the above claims cannot be said to be absolutely certain. However, they can be used by researchers as pieces of knowledge to be further investigated and by practitioners in development projects, always taking into account that they are preliminary findings",

The simulation of the manipulator by using the equation of motion directly requires intensive calculation. The scheme proposed in the paper uses the kinematic conditions of the adjoined links and their derivatives with respect to time. The linear and angular velocities and accelerations of the links are separated into two parts, one dependent on the motion of the satellite and the other the remainder whose values are determined by a recursive algorithm. The conservation laws of the total linear and angular momentums and the conditions for the total force and torque balance are used to determine the satellite body's linear and angular velocities and accelerations. These, in turn, make it possible to solve the kinematics and inverse dynamics of a satellite-based manipulator. The amount of calculations for the kinematics and inverse dynamics is proportional to the number of manipulator links.<\n>",

The fundamental limit to the frequency instability on the transmitted optical frequency is set by residual phase noise on the optical frequency resulting from the unavoidably imperfect Doppler cancellation of the fiber-link noise. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to quantitatively predict the phase noise and instability of the Doppler-cancelled transmitted optical frequency directly from the measured fiber-link noise. The ability to predict the frequency instability from the measured fiber noise can be a useful tool in evaluating whether a coherent fiber optic link is operating at its fundamental limit, or whether there is additional excess noise from the measurement system present in the link.",

The proposed resonant converter and the LLC series resonant converter (LLC-SRC) are in the same three-element resonant converter category and these two converters both consist of 2 inductors and one capacitor in their resonant tanks. While the LLC-SRC converter has all of its resonant elements on the input side, the proposed resonant converter has one of its resonant inductors on the output side. Utilizing the output resonant inductor allows the proposed resonant converter to implement self-driven synchronous rectifiers. When comparing the series resonant inductor in the LLC-SRC, the output inductor in the proposed resonant converter generally has lower cost and smaller size in voltage-step down applications. Operational analysis of the proposed resonant converter is made through sinusoidal approximation. A 250W prototype of the proposed resonant converter is built to verify the analysis made in this paper and evaluate its performance. With the same soft-switching characteristics as the LLC-SRC has, the proposed resonant converter can achieve 95.7% efficiency in a 430V to 27.5V/9A conversion even with diode rectifiers.",

  "abstract": "How to reduce the content placement cost of cloud content delivery networks (CCDNs) is a hot topic in recent years. Traditional content placement methods mainly reduce the cost of content placement by constructing delivery trees, but they cannot adapt to the dynamic deployment of cloud proxy servers in the CCDNs. In addition, the traditional content placement method only provides delivery paths according to local decision-making without considering global dynamics of the congestion in the CCDNs, which is also one of the main factors causing high cost of content placement. To solve these problems, we propose a content placement model based on Q-learning for the dynamic CCDNs, called Q-content placement model (Q-CPM). This Q-learning approach can lead to better routing decisions due to up-to-date and more reliable congestion values. Then, based on the Q-CPM model, an algorithm is proposed to construct the Q-adaptive delivery tree (Q-ADT). In this algorithm, local and nonlocal congestion information is propagated over network learning packets. Through this algorithm, the paths with low congestion cost will be selected and can adapt to the dynamic cloud delivery environment. The experimental results show that the method can adapt to the dynamic changes of the CCDNs flexibly and reduce the overall congestion cost of content placement effectively.",

The new compound was used as a curing agent for thermosetting epoxy resin Diglycidyl ether of Bispheol-A (DGEBA). The in built phenolic moiety accelerates the curing rate along with the amines thereby relatively lowering the curing temperature compared to the commercial aromatic curing agent such as diamino diphenyl ether (DDE) and also gives longer pot life compared to aliphatic amine such as triethyltriamine (TETRA). Cured polymer of DGEBA/APHCTA showed lower glass transition temperature(Tg) which imparts the flexibility and it also exhibits good thermal stability up to 340 °C. Activation energy (Eα) based on model free kinetics (MFK) method indicates the extent of curing of the reaction. Isothermal curing thermogram showed that the resin cures at lower temperature. Electrochemical Impedance study for the cured film of DGEBA/APHCTA coated on the copper plate exhibits good corrosion inhibition.

In this paper, we develop a novel 3D fully convolutional deep architecture for automated segmentation of retinal layers in OCT scans. This model extracts features from both the spatial and the inter-frame dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The proposed network is based on an encoder-decoder framework in which the convolution layers are interlaced with pooling layers in the encoder and with unpooling layers in the decoder, respectively. Consequently, a hierarchy of shrinking 3D feature maps are learned in the encoder and enlarged to the size of original input image for semantic segmentation in the decoder. The framework is validated on thirteen 3D OCTs captured by the Topcon 3D OCT with comparisons against two state-of-the-art segmentation methods including one recent 2D deep learning based approach to substantiate its effectiveness.",

It makes them attractive for cell imaging and biosensing. The underlying mechanism of the PL is a subject of intensive debates, although there are numerous reports on single-photon and multi-photon-induced PL of plasmonic particles and nanoparticle systems. Here, we experimentally and numerically show that the hot-spot intensity between two gold bipyramids anticorrelates with the one-photon photoluminescence from the dimers, where the plasmonic coupling is adjusted mechanically by seesawing the bipyramids and by varying the interparticle distance with the tip of an atomic force microscope [2]. This mechanical manipulation allows us not only to directly control the interparticle distance, but also to control the strength of the hot-spot in the gap of a dimer.",

This poses a challenge for designing self-powered sensors that monitor these quasi-static physical processes and at the same time scavenge operational energy for sensing, computation, and storage from the signal being monitored. In this paper, we present a novel paradigm for designing a self-powered sensor/data logger that exploits the physics of negative-stiffness mechanical energy concentrators with the physics of our previously reported piezoelectricity driven impact ionized hot-electron injection (p-IHEI)-based sensors. The operational principle is based on the sudden transitions from unstable mode branch switching during the elastic postbuckling response of slender columns, which are used to generate high-frequency deformations as an input to the p-IHEI-based sensor. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed self-powered sensor based on an integrated circuit fabricated in a 0.5-μm CMOS technology can count and record the number of quasi-static input events with frequencies spanning less than 1 Hz.",

The chamber is used with or without a compact-range reflector for compact-range or far-field measurement of antennas up to 0.6 m in diameter. The measured phase variation of the system, when idle, averages 0.3° over 227 s and 4.5° over 30 min. The amplitude stability is better than ±0.15 dB over a 63-h period. Verification of the system is obtained through comparison with other measurements and calculated results on horn and pillbox antennas.

This challenge can be addressed by microgrids, which are the new paradigm for defining the operation of the distribution system with high penetration of DERs. This paper presents a photovoltaic simulation model which can analyze the photovoltaic system response to particular weather condition. The model can be applied in a steady-state microgrid energy management system. The model was simulated, and the results were analyzed.

  "abstract": "Spatial distributions of soil contamination by \n137\nCs (89 sampling points) and \n239+240\nPu (76 points) near and within Dolon village were analyzed. An essential exponential decrease of contamination was found in Dolon village: the distance of a half reduction in contamination is about 0.87-1.25 km (in a northwest-southeast direction from the supposed centerline of the radioactive trace). This fact is in agreement with the available exposure rate measurements near Dolon (September 1949 archive data): on the basis of a few measurements the pattern of the trace was estimated to comprise a narrow 2 km corridor of maximum exposure rate. To compare computed external doses in air with local dose estimates by retrospective luminescence dosimetry (RLD) the gradient of radioactive soil contamination within the village was accounted for. The computed dose associated with the central axis of the trace was found to be equal to 2260 mGy (calculations based on archive exposure rate data). Local doses near the RLD sampling points (southeast of the village) were calculated to be in the range 466-780 mGy (averaged value: 645+/-70 mGy), which is comparable with RLD data (averaged value 460+/-92 mGy with range 380-618 mGy). A comparison of the computed mean dose in the settlement with dose estimates by ESR tooth enamel dosimetry makes it possible to estimate the “upper level” of the “shielding and behavior” factor in dose reduction for inhabitants of Dolon village which was found to be 0.28+/-0.068.",

We consider two models for minihalo formation and three typical thermal states of the IGM – heating purely by ionization, heating from both ionizing and Lyα photons and a maximal ‘strong heating’ model. We find that the signal from the IGM is almost always dominant over that from minihaloes. In our calculation, the differential brightness temperature, δT\nb\n, of minihaloes is never larger than 2 mK. Although there are indeed some differences in the signals from the minihaloes and from the IGM, even with the planned generation of radio telescopes it will be unfeasible to detect them. However, minihaloes significantly affect the ionization state of the IGM and the corresponding 21-cm flux.",

In this letter, we propose a robust and practical SL illumination pattern coding method based on epipolar geometry. The proposed pattern can effectively alleviate coding redundancy in traditional global random speckle SL patterns and make the stereo matching more robust to noise. Meanwhile, this coding strategy supplies sufficient non-local similar blocks, which inspires us to propose a uni-direction block-stacking 3D filtering algorithm to further improve the 3D imaging quality. To verify the proposed algorithms, we developed a prototype using the off-the-shelf projector and camera. Both simulation and real scene experimental results show that the proposed methods can achieve high-quality 3D imaging performance under different noisy conditions.",

Objective (a) is experimentally investigated by the pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) technique, well known for determining spatial charge distribution in dielectrics. Objective (b) is investigated by determining the ultrasonic velocity response of the modified composites and unfilled polymer. The obtained results suggest a relation between electrical threshold fields for S.C. accumulation & fill-grades, as well as the fact that incorporating stiff filler materials into brittle polymer bases leads to a tougher composite (capable of withstanding greater breaking stress levels), but with reduced ductility.",

A sensor array consisting of such sensory cells can operate in the frequency band just for a single sensor. The delay time can be designated in a rather wide range so that the array can address as many as required sensory cells simply by time-division through delay time. A single sensory cell consists of different kinds of SAW devices, and the devices may be integrated together on a single piezoelectric substrate in manufacturing or may be simply combined together using separate devices.
