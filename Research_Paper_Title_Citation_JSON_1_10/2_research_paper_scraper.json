  "abstract": "For measurements to be worthwhile, they must be linked to the goals of an organization. Automated data collection systems are effective, but they can encourage collecting only data that is easily available. The Fixed Switching unit from Nokia has automated data collection systems supporting its processes. It started measurement based improvement of the fault management process by defining goal-driven metrics on top of the existing systems. Fault management includes the analysis and correction of faults, and the delivery of corrections. The work consisted of translating high-level goals into measurement goals, applying the Goal-Question-Metric paradigm to identify questions and indicators, and identifying needed data. Starting with a workshop setting helped to get practitioners involved. Having specified measurement goals helped defining concrete metrics that are targeted at specific audiences. The defined metrics serve the purposes of monitoring fault traffic, and process improvement. Metrics need to evolve, and the metrics implemented first use only data from the fault tracking system, providing the best reporting facilities at the moment. However, metrics that require qualitative checking of data cannot be automated.",

The ultra-high quality factor (Q) makes them promising ranging from sensors, filters to low threshold sources. In the above supplications, the frequency stability of the WGM is critical, which is determined by several factors. In this paper, using the microsphere resonator we construct a robust packaged microsphere-taper coupling system (MTCS) to stabilize the resonant WGMs. Furthermore, a stable frequency references platform based on the packaged microcavity unit is constructed. This stable frequency references platform can eliminate the noise of the WGM, and promote the microresonator researches.",

  "abstract": "The Domain Green's Function Method (DGFM) is a Method-of-Moments (MoM) based domain decomposition approach that is useful for the analysis of large, irregular antenna arrays. Mutual coupling between array elements is accounted for with the formulation of an active impedance matrix equation for each of the domains/array elements. The active current distribution on the entire array geometry is then obtained by solving these smaller matrix equations pertaining to the elements. The active impedance matrix calculation entails a summation of the MoM matrix diagonal and off-diagonal sub-matrices. For arrays containing a large number of elements this summation can lead to matrix fill times similar to that of the global MoM calculation. To mitigate this significant computational overhead, while still maintaining a sufficient degree of accuracy, the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) algorithm is applied to accelerate this part of the DGFM.",

The procedure is based on the transfer matrix method and utilizes a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm for the solution of the resulting transcendental equations. By applying a semi-analytical approach, the algorithm shows very good convergence behavior even for structures containing metallic layers. Analytic forms of the transcendental equations for transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarization for systems with one to four boundaries are presented. Conducting interfaces can, for instance, be used to describe a 2-D electron gas or a planar metamaterial. We demonstrate the performance of this method by examples which are of current technological interest. These include surface waves bound to surface carriers on p-InAs, a parallel plate waveguide and plasma oscillations in a high electron mobility transistor structure.",

In this paper, we present a fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm over sliding window for the missing value imputation of incomplete data to improve the data quality. The experiments show that our missing data imputation algorithm tends to be more tolerant of imprecision and uncertainty and can lead to a better performance with accuracy guarantees.",

We thoroughly study the problem of nearest neighbour search using MIL based on upper bound pruning. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale tweet dataset.

  "abstract": "In mixed-line-rate (MLR) networks, various data rates, on varied wavelengths, exist on a fiber. In MLR networks, end-to-end lightpaths can be established with the desired line rate; requiring advanced modulation formats for higher data rates. However, along the route, the signals experience different physical layer impairments (PLIs), and their quality also worsens. The transmission signal quality is affected by the launch power, which must be high for lesser noise at the receiver, and must also be low, such that the PLIs do not start to distort the signal. Further, higher launch power also disrupts the existing lightpath and its neighbours. We propose a weighted strategy for provisioning PLI-aware (PLI-A) lightpaths in MLR networks. Through the simulations, we compare and demonstrate that the proposed strategy demonstrates better performances than our previously proposed algorithm (i.e. PLI-Average (PLI-A)), and existing approaches.",

  "abstract": "In this knowledge-based economy, knowledge has become an important asset to an organization and, consequently, knowledge management has emerged, as issue managers have to deal with Peter F. Drucker (1993) said that knowledge would be the only competitive resource for companies in the future. This is an era in which knowledge plays a dominant role in our daily business lives. Intellectual capital has gradually taken the place of traditional tangible capital in many business organizations. However, practitioners are often puzzled about where they stand, how well they are doing, and what they should do next. This paper aims to construct a knowledge management maturity model as a means to help answer these and related questions. There are three components in the proposed model: maturity levels, knowledge management processes, and knowledge management capabilities or enabling infrastructures. The maturity levels are based on the capability maturity model (CMM) of SEI. This model divides the knowledge management process into four main sub-processes: knowledge creation, knowledge storage, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application, emphasizing the need for continuous process improvement. Furthermore, knowledge management enablers are integrated into KMMM to describe how it supports the practices at each maturity level. The applicability of this model is evaluated through case studies, which also serve to illustrate how knowledge management practices among organizations are compared, and what maturity paths organizations can follow. Three banks were taken for cases study through in depth interview with their senior managements. By analyzing data gathered through the process described above, the conclusion of this study is induced.",

Moreover, an effective iris segmentation method is proposed to refine the detected inner and outer boundaries to smooth curves. For feature extraction, the Gabor filters are adopted to detect the local feature points from the segmented iris image in the Cartesian coordinate system and to generate a rotation-invariant descriptor for each detected point. After that, the proposed matching algorithm is used to compute a similarity score for two sets of feature points from a pair of iris images. The experimental results show that the performance of our system is better than those of the systems based on the local features and is comparable to those of the typical systems.",

We carry out vibration analysis of a single phase of a reactor while considering electromagnetism and magnetostriction to clarify the mechanism of noise generation in the reactor. In this analysis, magnetostriction is modeled three-dimensionally with equivalent nodal forces. First, the nodal forces in the cores of reactor due to the electromagetism and magnetostriction are calculated using the flux distribution obtained from magnetic field analysis. To determine the dominant cause of noise, the spatial distributions of displacements generated by both nodal forces are then obtained by static structure analysis and they are compared in detail. Moreover, the actual movements of the cores are calculated by vibration analysis. Finally, the effect of the hardness of the cores on noise generation is calculated and measured. It is shown that the hardness of the insulator inserted in gaps between cores affects the vibration and it seems to have an optimal value. Moreover, the analyzed results are proved by measurement.",

EEG signals were recorded from three reference electrodes (Fz, C3, and C4) and from six additional electrodes located close to the reference electrodes. The performance of four different feature extraction methods [power spectral density (PSD), phase locking value (PLV), a combination of PSD and PLV, and cross-correlation (CC)] were evaluated in terms of robustness to electrode location changes as well as regarding absolute classification accuracy. The quantitative evaluation results demonstrated that the use of either PSD- or CC-based features led to higher classification accuracy than the use of PLV-based features, whereas PSD-based features showed much higher sensitivity to changes in EEG electrode location than CC- or PLV-based features. There results suggest that CC can be a promising feature extraction method in motor-imagery-based BCI studies as it provides high classification accuracy along with being little affected by slight changes in the EEG electrode locations.",
