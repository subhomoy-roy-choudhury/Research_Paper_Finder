  "abstract": "This paper demonstrates the use of quantitative live cell imaging techniques for assessing the quality of stem cell cultures. The aim is to investigate the use of advanced image analysis techniques to objectively assess and reliably characterize spinal cord motor neurite interactions with human bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) in an in vitro spinal cord injury model which has been developed recently. The principal goal is to better understand the mechanism responsible for neuronal growth and regeneration that are believed to be responsible for the functional improvements noted following cell transplantation for the treatment of lesions to the central nervous system."

Typical results of antennas designed to operate at 2.450 GHz indicate a broadening of the 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth from approximately 19 MHz with a load impedance of R/sub L/=1.0 M Omega to a value in excess of 130 MHz for R/sub L/=50 Omega .<\n>"

Large photocurrent and optical response enhancement are achieved over a conventional p-i-n Ge photodetector, which is predominantly attributed to the current gain induced by transistor actions. When illuminated with a photon wavelength of 1.55 mum , a Ge phototransistor shows a large responsivity of ~ 2.0 A/W for a low operating bias \nVA\n of 1.0 V. Optical measurement results further show that good photoresponse could be achieved for a spectral range of 1.31-1.62 mum, making such a device a very promising option for optical detections in the near-infrared (including \nL\n -band) wavelength regime."

  "abstract": "High quality view synthesis is a prerequisite for future free-viewpoint television. It will enable viewers to move freely in a dynamic real world scene. Depth image based rendering algorithms will play a pivotal role when synthesizing an arbitrary number of novel views by using a subset of captured views and corresponding depth maps only. Usually, each depth map is estimated individually by stereo-matching algorithms and, hence, shows lack of inter-view consistency. This inconsistency affects the quality of view synthesis negatively. This paper enhances the inter-view consistency of multiview depth imagery. First, our approach classifies the color information in the multiview color imagery by modeling color with a mixture of Dirichlet distributions where the model parameters are estimated in a Bayesian framework with variational inference. Second, using the resulting color clusters, we classify the corresponding depth values in the multiview depth imagery. Each clustered depth image is subject to further sub-clustering. Finally, the resulting mean of each sub-cluster is used to enhance the depth imagery at multiple viewpoints. Experiments show that our approach improves the average quality of virtual views by up to 0.8 dB when compared to views synthesized by using conventionally estimated depth maps."

These protocols have enabled IoT applications such as smart home, fleet management, oil pipelines and space exploration that heavily depend on reliable communications. This paper investigates utilization of MQTT protocol for a smart home security system. A Raspberry Pi implementation detects an intrusion event using a passive infrared sensor triggering an image capture which is then communicated to the subscribed client for countermeasures.

Since the high dimension of observation data, sparse feature learning plays an important role in overcoming the challenge of high variable dimension and low sample size problem among the disease identification. In this paper, sparse Elastic Net (EN) was used to extract low dimension features and to identify the Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compare with principal component analysis (PCA) method, the EN method can solve the problems of less samples and high correlations between variables. For those variables sharing the same biological phenomenon, it selected whole groups into the model automatically once one variable among them was selected. Unlike other subspace learning methods, the proposed method used less man-made feature setting. The problems of dimension reduction and classification were conducted into a similar formulation. Experimental results illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed method."

  "abstract": "Using muons in high energy colliders has an advantage in that the muons emit negligible synchrotron radiation, but has the disadvantage that the lifetime of the muons is very short. The latter requires that the muons be accelerated as rapidly as possible to prevent particle loss. The former allows one to loop back and pass through the same linac multiple times, thereby achieving potentially significant cost advantages. Some of the acceleration systems will use recirculating linacs to achieve the reuse of the accelerating structures. However, the large longitudinal beam emittances make it difficult to simultaneously achieve large gradients by using high frequency RF and design an arc with a sufficient energy acceptance. The current state of the design for the acceleration stages for a muon collider is presented, with emphasis on systems accelerating to 70 GeV per beam. Known difficulties will be described as will their possible solutions. In particular, the use of an FFAG-like lattice for the arcs of a recirculating linac is described which accepts a beam with a very large energy spread over a wide range of energies, allowing a single are to be used instead of multiple arcs."

  "abstract": "A new method for obtaining series of window functions is introduced. A novel form of frequency response expression of digital filters is deduced which is sum of sinc sum functions. One of the remarkable characteristics of the form is that weights(coefficients of terms) of window functions can be directly calculated according to the expression. An example for how to find a window function is illustrated in detail. An instance of series of window functions is tabled with both window weights and filter performances. Stopband attenuation of filters is from 32 db to 63 db with the gap about 3 db. With same performances of stopband attenuation and transition width both the order and passband ripple of filters using the new method is little better than that using Kaiser window if passband attenuation is smaller than 50 db and little worse if bigger than 52 db. The obtained window functions are as simple as Blackman window function. The outstanding feature of the new approach is that it can provide a very efficient way to find series of window functions with both good performances and easy calculation."

  "abstract": "Adaptive predictive coding of speech signals at bit rates lower than 10 kbits/sec often requires the use of 2-level (1 bit) quantization of the samples of the prediction residual. Such a coarse quantization of the prediction residual can produce audible quantizing noise in the reproduced speech signal at the receiver. This paper describes a new method of quantization for improving the speech quality. The improvement is obtained by center clipping the prediction residual and by fine quantization of the high-amplitude portions of the prediction residual. The threshold of center clipping is adjusted to provide encoding of the prediction residual at a specified bit rate. This method of quantization not only improves the speech quality by accurate quantization of the prediction residual when its amplitude is large but also allows encoding of the prediction residual at bit rates below 1 bit/sample."

We compared FAI echoes collocated with 630 nm airglow depletion detected by an all-sky imager. The thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures obtained by a Fabry-Perot interferometer at Kototabang and the altitudes of F-layer (h'F) observed with ionosondes at Kototabang, Chiang Mai, and Chumphon were also examined. We found that the 3-m scale post-midnight FAIs occurred within plasma bubbles. The convergence of the equatorward neutral winds happened in this particular event related to midnight temperature maximum (MTM) and that the equatorward winds in both northern and southern hemispheres could be responsible for the growth of plasma bubbles around midnight. The uplift of F-layer at low latitudes could increase the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Eastward electric currents driven by the equatorward winds could also contribute to the generation of the irregularities at post-midnight."

  "abstract": "Common hardware exceptions, when implemented by trapping, unnecessarily serialize program execution in dynamically scheduled superscalar processors. To avoid the consequences of trapping the main program thread, multithreaded CPUs can exploit control and data independence by executing the exception handler in a separate hardware context. The main thread doesn't squash instructions after the excepting instruction, conserving fetch bandwidth and allowing execution of instructions independent of the exception. This leads to earlier branch resolution in the post exception code and additional memory latency tolerance. As a proof of concept, using threads to handle software TLB misses is shown to provide performance approaching that of an aggressive hardware TLB miss handler."

A comparative analysis of several prior arts, including arbitrary frequency response polynomial (AFRP) and basis spline (B-spline) is also presented, giving a clear overview of the advantages associated with the proposed technique in terms of implementation complexity, latency, and in-band and out-of-band spectral performance. The measurement results with three different radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) prototypes using an input stimulus comprised of different instantaneous bandwidth (iBW) carrier aggregated 5G new radio (NR) waveform are demonstrated to highlight the improved performance in the context of digital predistortion (DPD) correction.

  "abstract": "A new class of multiple-error correcting codes has been developed. Since it belongs to the class of one-step-decodable majority codes, it can be decoded at an exceptionally high speed. This class of codes is derived from a set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares. This mutually orthogonal property provides a class of codes having a unique feature of “modularity.” The parity check matrix possesses a uniform pattern and results in a small number of inputs to modulo 2 adders. This class of codes has m\n2\n data bits, where m is an integer, and 2tm check bits for t-error correcting."

  "abstract": "A generalized discrete time-domain modeling and analysis technique is presented for all types of switching regulators using any type of duty-cycle controller and operating in both continuous and discontinuous inductor currents. State-space techniques are employed to derive an equivalent nonlinear discrete time model that describes the converter exactly. The system is linearized about its equilibrium state to obtain a linear discrete time model for small signal performance evaluations, such as stability, audiosusceptibility, and transient response. The analysis makes extensive use of the digital computer as an analytical tool. It is universal, exact, and easy to use."
